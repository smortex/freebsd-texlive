The theoremref package provides variants of the \label and \ref
commands for theorem-like environments, capable of
automatically typesetting references including the theorem name
(apart from the theorem number). The scheme is particularly
valuable if the author decides to change a lemma to a
proposition or a theorem (or whatever).
