‘ionumbers’ stands for ‘input/output numbers’. The
package restyles numbers in maths mode. If a number in the
input file is written, e.g., as $3,231.44$ as commonly used in
English texts, the package is able to restyle it to be output
as $3\,231{,}44$ as commonly used in German texts (and vice
versa). This may be useful, for example, if you have a large
table and want to include it in texts with different output
conventions without the need to change the table. The package
can also automatically group digits left of the decimal
separator (thousands) and right of the decimal separator
(thousandths) in triplets without the need of specifing commas
(English) or points (German) as separators. E.g., the input
$1234.567890$ can be output as $1\,234.\,567\,890$. Finally, an
e starts the exponent of the number. For example, $21e6$ may be
output as $26\times10\,^{6}$.
