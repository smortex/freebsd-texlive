Defines macros for third-person singular pronouns (\E, \Em,
\Eir, \Eirs), which expand differently according to a
masculine/feminine switch. (If the switch is ‘masculine’,
they would expand to ‘he’, ‘him’, ‘his’ and
‘his’; if ‘feminine’, they would expand to ‘she’,
‘her’, ‘her’ and ‘hers". Apart from the pronouns, one
can define ‘word pairs’, such as mother/father,
daughter/son, and so on. Gender may be defined once per
document, as an environment, or may be flipped on the fly.
