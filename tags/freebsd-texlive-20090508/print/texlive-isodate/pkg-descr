This package provides ten output formats of the commands
\today, \printdate, \printdateTeX, and \daterange (partly
language dependent). Formats available are: ISO (yyyy-mm-dd),
numeric (e.g. dd.\,mm.~yyyy), short (e.g. dd.\,mm.\,yy), TeX
(yyyy/mm/dd), original (e.g. dd. mmm yyyy), short original
(e.g. dd. mmm yy), as well as numerical formats with Roman
numerals for the month. The commands \printdate and
\printdateTeX print any date. The command \daterange prints a
date range and leaves out unnecessary year or month entries.
This package supports German (old and new rules), Austrian, US
English, British English, French, Danish, Swedish, and
Norwegian.
