Curve2e extends the drawing capacities of the new standard
pict2e LaTeX package. In particular, it introduces new macros
for lines and vectors, new specifications for line terminations
and joins, arcs with any angular aperture, arcs with arrows at
one or both ends, generic curves specified with their nodes and
the tangent direction at these nodes.
