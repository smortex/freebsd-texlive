The package provides picture-mode environments whose size is
related to the size of the page. The fullpict environment takes
arguments to specify the dimension of the picture in picture
mode ‘unit lengths’; the value for \unitlength is defined
by the fact that the picture is to be 90% of \textwidth.
Similar environments halfpict (half the width of fullpict), and
scalepict (a given percentage of the width of fullpict), are
also defined.
