PSfragX offers a mechanism to embed \psfrag commands, as
provided by the psfrag package, into the EPS file itself. Each
time a graphic is included, the EPS file is scanned. If some
tagged lines are found, they are used to define the psfrag
replacements that should be performed automatically. In
addition, a similar mechanism holds for overpic objects. These
are picture objects superimposed on the included graphic. A
similar mechanism is implemented in psfrag itself (but
deprecated in the documentation), but psfragx offers much more
flexibility. For example, if babel is used, it is possible to
define different replacements corresponding to different
languages. The replacements to take into account will be
selected on the basis of the current language of the document.
A Matlab script (LaPrint) is provided, to export an EPS file
with psfragx annotations ready embedded.
