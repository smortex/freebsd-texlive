Having lost the overview of my DVD archives, I simply could not
remember if I already recorded the documentary running on TV
that day. I chose to recreate the index using LaTeX: the design
aim was a hyperlinked and fully searchable PDF-document,
listing my DVDs with all titles, lengths and so on. Further
requirements were support for seasons of tv series and a list
with all faulty or missing programs for rerecording. The
dvdcoll class supports all these requirements. dvdcoll.cls
follows the structure <number><title><length>. As a result, the
class is not limited to DVDsâ€”you can of course typeset
archives of CD-ROMs, Audio-CDs and so on. Supported languages
at the moment: English, French, German, Italian, Polish,
Portuguese, Spanish. Some help is needed for other languages!
