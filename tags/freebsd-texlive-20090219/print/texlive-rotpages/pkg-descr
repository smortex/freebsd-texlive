The rotpages package allows you to format documents where small
sets of pages are rotated by 180 degrees and rearranged, so
that they can be read by turning the printed copy upside-down.
It was primarly meant for collecting exercises and solutions:
using the package, you can print the exercise text normally and
the solutions rotated.
