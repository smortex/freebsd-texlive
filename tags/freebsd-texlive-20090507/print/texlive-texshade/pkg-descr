TeXshade is an alignment shading software completely written in
TeX/LaTeX which can process multiple sequence alignments in the
.MSF and the .ALN file format. It provides in addition to
common shading algorithms special shading modes featuring
functional aspects, e.g. charge or hydropathy, and a plenitude
of commands for handling shading colours, text styles, labels,
legends and even allows the user to define completely new
shading modes. TeXshade combines highest flexibility and the
habitual TeX output qualityâ€”with reasonable time expenditure.
