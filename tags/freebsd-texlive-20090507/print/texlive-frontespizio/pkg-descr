Typesetting a frontispiece independently of the layout of the
main document is difficult. This package provides a solution by
producing an auxiliary TeX file to be typeset on its own and
the result is automatically included at the next run. The
markup necessary for the frontispiece is written in the main
document in a frontespizio environment. Documentation is mainly
in Italian, as the style is probably apt only to theses in
Italy.
