The dottex package allows you to encapsulate ‘dot’ and
‘neato’ files in your document (dot and neato are both part
of graphviz; dot creates directed graphs, neato undirected
graphs). If you have shell-escape enabled, the package will
arrange for your files to be processed at LaTeX time;
otherwise, the conversion must be done manually as an
intermediate process before a second LaTeX run.
