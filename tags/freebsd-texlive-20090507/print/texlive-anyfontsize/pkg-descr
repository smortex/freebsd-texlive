The package allows the to user select any font size (via e.g.
\fontsize{...}{...}\selectfont), even those sizes that are not
listed in the .fd file. If such a size is requested, LaTeX will
search for and select the nearest listed size; anyfontsize will
then scale the font to the size actually requested. Similar
functionality is available for the CM family, for the EC
family, or for either computer modern encoding; the present
package generalises the facility.
