The LH fonts address the problem of the wide variety of
alphabets that are written with Cyrillic-style characters. The
fonts are the original basis of the set of T2* and X2 encodings
that are now used when LaTeX users need to write in Cyrillic
languages. LH offers the latex/lhfonts bundle of packages for
standard LaTeX Cyrillic and traditional encodings. The fonts
are available in Adobe Type 1 format, in the CM-Super family of
fonts.
