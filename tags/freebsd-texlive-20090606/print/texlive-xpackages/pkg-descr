The name xpackages is a designation used for prototype
implementations of new concepts for a LaTeX Designer Interface.
Some of the packages work standalone providing new
functionality, such as the packages in xbase; others go deeper
and redefine LaTeX internals in order to provide newer and
better methods for managing certain constructs. All packages
provided through xpackages require the packages provided in
expl3, and in addition may require functionality provided by
the packages if the xbase bundle. Included in this release of
xpackages are the bundles xbase and xtheorem. The xbase bundle
provides the packages xparse and template, and the support
package ldcsetup. The xtheorem bundle provides a prototype
reimplementation of the AMS-LaTeX, using the template
mechanism.
