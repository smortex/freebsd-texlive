pst-func is a package built for use with PSTricks. It provides
macros for plotting various mathematical functions: –
polynomials and their derivatives f(x)=an*x^n+an-1*x^(n-
1)+...+a0 defined by the coefficients a0 a1 a2 ... and the
derivative order; – the Fourier sum f(x) = a0/2+a1cos(omega
x)+...+b1sin(omega x)+... defined by the coefficients a0 a1 a2
... b1 b2 b3 ...; – the Bessel function defined by its order;
– the Gauss function defined by sigma and mu; – Bezier
curves from order 1 (two control points) to order 9 (10 control
points); – the superellipse function (the Lamé curve); –
Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind; – the
Thomae (or popcorn) function; – various integration-derived
functions; – binomial distribution functions; and –
implicit functions. The plots may be generated as volumes of
rotation about the X-axis, as well.
