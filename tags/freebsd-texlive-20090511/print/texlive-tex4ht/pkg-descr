A converter from TeX and LaTeX to SGML-based formats such as
(X)HTML, MathML, OpenDocument, and DocBook, providing a
configurable (La)TeX-based authoring system for hypertext.
TeX4ht is released once a year; fixes for problems (and new
extensions) may be found on the package bugfixes page. Tex4ht
does not parse (La)TeX source (so that it avoids the
difficulties encountered by many other converters, arising from
the irregularity of (La)TeX syntax). Instead, Tex4ht uses
(La)TeX itself (with an extra macro package) to produce a non-
standard DVI file that it can then process. This technique
gives TeX4ht the robustness characteristic of restricted-syntax
systems such as hyperlatex and gellmu.
