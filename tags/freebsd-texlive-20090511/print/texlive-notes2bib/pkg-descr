The notes2bib package defines a new type of note, bibnote,
which will always be added to the bibliography. The package
allows footnotes and endnotes to be moved into the bibliography
in the same way. The package can be used with natbib and
biblatex as well as plain LaTeX citations. Both sorted and
unsorted bibliography styles are supported. The package makes
use of the e-TeX extensions (any post-2005 LaTeX distribution
will provide these by default, but users of older systems may
need to use an elatex command or equivalent). It also makes use
of the xkeyval and etoolbox packages.
