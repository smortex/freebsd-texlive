The package is designed to localise any document class or
package. This should be very useful for end-users who could
obtain messages in their own preferred language. It is really
easy to use by writers of other classes and packages.
Volunteers are urged to test the package, report, and even to
localise the message file to their own language. Documentation
is provided in English.
