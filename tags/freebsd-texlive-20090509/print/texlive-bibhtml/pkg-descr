Bibhtml consists of a Perl script and a set of BibTeX style
files, which together allow you to compile a bibliography for a
collection of HTML files. The references in the text are linked
directly to the corresponding bibliography entry, and if a URL
is defined in the entry within the BibTeX database file, then
the generated bibliography entry is linked to this. The package
provides three different style files derived from each of the
standard plain.bst and alpha.bst (i.e., six in total).
