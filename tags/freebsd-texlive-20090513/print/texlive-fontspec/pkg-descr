Fontspec is a package for XeLaTeX. It provides an automatic and
unified interface to feature-rich AAT and OpenType fonts
through the NFSS in LaTeX running on XeTeX. XeTeX (the
successor to TeX-GX) is a TeX-variant (originally for Mac OS X,
but now available in the major distributions for other
platforms, too) that accepts unicode input and can access
system fonts directly.
