Pst-cox is a PSTricks package for drawing 2-dimensional
projections of complex regular polytopes (after the work of
Coxeter). The package consists of a macro library for drawing
the projections. The complex polytopes appear in the study of
the root systems and play a crucial role in many domains
related to mathematics and physics. These polytopes have been
completely described by Coxeter in his book “Regular Complex
Polytopes”. There exist only a finite numbers of exceptional
regular complex polytopes (for example the icosahedron) and
some infinite series (for example, one can construct a multi-
dimensional analogue of the hypercube in any finite dimension).
The library contains two packages. The first, pst-coxcoor, is
devoted to the exceptional complex regular polytopes whose
coordinates have been pre-computed. The second, pst-coxeterp,
is devoted to the infinite series.
