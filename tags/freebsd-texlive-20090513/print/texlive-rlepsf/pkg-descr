A macro package for use with epsf.tex which allows PostScript
labels in an Encapsulated PostScript file to be replaced by TeX
labels. The package provides commands \relabel (simply replace
a PostScript string), \adjustrelabel (replace a PostScript
string, with position adjustment), and \extralabel (add a label
at given coordinates). You can, if you so choose, use the
facilities of the labelfig package in place of using
\extralabel.
