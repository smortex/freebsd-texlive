The expl3 bundle provides the foundation on which the LaTeX3
kernel and other advanced extensions are built, as a set of
packages that work with LaTeX 2e. They provide an API for TeX
programmers. Each module is set up in such a way that it can be
used with regular LaTeX 2e packages even though the coding
style is somewhat different. All files are also available in
the Subversion (SVN) repository of the LaTeX3 Project. The
bundle on CTAN is a snapshot of the SVN repository as of
2008/08/01.
