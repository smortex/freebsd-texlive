The package helps to typeset exercises or list of exercises
within any document. Exercises, questions, sub-questions are
automatically numbered. It is possible to put answers in the
same document, and display them immediatly, later in the
document or not at all. The layout of exercise is fully
customisable. It is then possible to typeset long problems,
short exercises, questionnaires, etc. Usage of the babel
package is detected, but not fully supported by now (only
english and french are implemented).
