The rsc package provides a BibTeX style in accordance with the
requirements of the Royal Society of Chemistry. It was
originally based on the file pccp.bst, but also implements a
number of styles from the achemso package. The package is now a
stub for the chemstyle package, which the author developed to
unify the writing of articles with a chemistry content.
