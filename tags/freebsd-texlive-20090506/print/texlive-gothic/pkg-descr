printing. The set comprises Gothic, Schwabacher and Fraktur
fonts, a pair of handwriting fonts, Süetterlin and Schwell,
and a font containing decorative initials. In addition, there
are two re-encoding packages for Haralambous's fonts, providing
T1, using virtual fonts, and OT1 and T1, using Metafont.
