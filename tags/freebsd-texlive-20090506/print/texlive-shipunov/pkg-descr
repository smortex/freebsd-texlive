The bundle collects packages and classes, along with one
bibliography style and examples and scripts for converting TeX
files. Many of the files in the collection are designed to
support field biologists and/or Russian writers, while others
have wider application. The collection includes (among others):
– biokey, which provides a mechanism for typesetting
biological identification lists; – sltables, which develops
on the stables package, for use in a LaTeX context
