This package uses the (La)TeX extension -shell-escape to
establish whether the document is being processed on a Windows
or on a Unix-like system (Mac OS X, Linux, etc.). Booleans
provided are: – \ifwindows, – \iflinux and – \ifmacosx.
The package also preserves the output of uname on a Unix-like
system, which may be used to distinguish between various
classes of Unix systems.
