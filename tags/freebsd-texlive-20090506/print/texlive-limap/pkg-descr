The Information Mapping method provides a methodology for
structuring and presenting information. It claims to be useful
for readers who are more concerned about finding the right
information than reading the document as a whole. Thus short,
highly structured, and context free pieces of information are
used. A LaTeX style and a LaTeX class are provided. The style
contains definitions to typeset maps and blocks according to
the Information Mapping method. The class provides all
definitions to typeset a whole document.
