This is a package version of nfssfont.tex (part of the LaTeX
distribution); it enables you to print a table of the
characters of a font and/or some example text, from within a
document. (Packages like testfont and nfssfont.tex run as
interactive programs: the user is expected to type details of
what is needed. Note that the package mftinc also has a
\fonttable function.
