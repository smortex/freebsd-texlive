The package defines a mechanism for specifying connected trees
that uses a tabular environment to generate node positions. The
package uses PostScript code, loaded by dvips, so output can
only be generated by use of dvips. The package lingmacros.sty
defines a few macros for linguists: \enumsentence for
enumerating sentence examples, simple tabular-based non-
connected tree macros, and gloss macros.
