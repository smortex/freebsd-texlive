The changes-package allows the user to manually markup changes
of text, such as additions, deletions, or replacements. Changed
text is shown in a different colour; deleted text is crossed
out. The package allows free defining of additional authors and
their associated colour. It also allows you to define a markup
for authors or annotations.
