= Installing TeXLive on FreeBSD =

== Adding TeXLive ports to your FreeBSD ports tree ==

There are basically two ways for having the TeXLive ports in your FreeBSD ports tree:
  * Fetch already generated ports using portshaker;
  * Generate the ports yourself.

=== Fetching already generated ports (recommended) ===

FreeBSD ports for all TeXLive packages are located in the `releng` branch of the repository. Install it using portshaker:

{{{
shell> make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portshaker-config install # Ensure TEXLIVE is checked
shell> portshaker -v
}}}

The ports are updated daily. [Upgrading]

=== Generate the ports yourself (NOT recommended) ===

==== Checkout the FreeBSD-TeXLive trunk ====

{{{
shell> mkdir freebsd-texlive
shell> cd freebsd-texlive
shell> svn co "http://freebsd-texlive.googlecode.com/svn/trunk"
shell> ln -s trunk/Tools/texlive Makefile
shell> $EDITOR Makefile # Tweak to fit your needs
shell> make
}}}

You should update your ports quite often since TeXLive tarballs are updated daily.  A crontab will hopefully do it for you while you sleep

== What next? ==

you will have a brunch of TeXLive ports in print/texlive-_foo_.  You will need texlive-core which installs the binaries.  The texlive-scheme-_foo_ and texlive-collection-_foo_ ports can help you install large collections of ports if you don't want to pin only the packages you use.
