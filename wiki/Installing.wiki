= How to install TeXLive on FreeBSD =

There are basically two ways for running TeXLive on FreeBSD:
  * Use TeXLive ports from the FreeBSD-TeXLive repository;
  * Build your own TeXLive ports.

== Installing from the FreeBSD-TeXLive repository (recommanded) ==

FreeBSD ports for all TeXLive packages are located in the `releng` branch of the repository. Install it using portshaker:

{{{
shell> make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portshaker-config install # Ensure TEXLIVE is checked
shell> portshaker -v
}}}

== Building your own TeXLive ports (NOT recommanded) ==

=== Checkout the FreeBSD-TeXLive trunk ===

{{{
shell> mkdir freebsd-texlive
shell> cd freebsd-texlive
shell> svn co "http://freebsd-texlive.googlecode.com/svn/trunk"
shell> ln -s trunk/Tools/texlive Makefile
shell> $EDITOR Makefile # Tweak to fit your needs
shell> make
}}}

You should update your ports quite often since TeXLive tarballs are updated daily.  A crontab will hopefully do it for you while you sleep

= Custom PREFIX =

As suggested in Issue 17, it is possible to install TeXLive ports under a custom PREFIX to avoid clashes with teTeX.  This can be achieved my modifying `/etc/make.conf`:

{{{
.if (!empty(.CURDIR:M/usr/ports/print/texlive-*))
PREFIX=         /usr/local/texlive
.endif
}}}
