BaskervilleF is a fork from the Libre Baskerville fonts (Roman,
Italic, Bold only) released under the OFL by Paolo Impallari
and Rodrigo Fuenzalida. Their font are optimized for web usage,
while BaskervilleF is optimized for traditional TeX usage,
normally destined for production of pdf files. A bold italic
style was added and mathematical support is offered as an
option to newtxmath.
