This is a LaTeX package that provides a command to produce
dummy text interspersed with \index commands to test an index
style or indexing application. The dummy text is mostly in
English, but includes extended Latin characters provided either
through LaTeX accent commands or directly with UTF-8
characters, depending on the setup, to allow for testing
extended Latin alphabets.
