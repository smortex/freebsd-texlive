Econometrics is a package that defines some commands that
simplify mathematic notation in economic and econometrics
writing. The commands are related to the notation of vectors,
matrices, sets, calligraphic and roman letters statistical
distributions constants and symbols matrix operators and
statistical operators. The package is based on "Notation in
Econometrics: a proposal for a standard" by Karim Abadir and
Jan R. Magnus, The Econometrics Journal (2002), 5, 76-90.
