The package replaces \ref with \figureref, \sectionref, \eqref,
etc., so that you're forced to specify the kind of label you're
referencing. Each reference command also generates appropriate
text automatically, so that instead of typing
Figure~\ref{figure:key}, all you need is
\figureref{figure:key}. The \label command is redefined to
record the type with the label defined, so that each type of
label has its own namespace.
