The betababel package extends the babel polutonikogreek option
to provide a simple way to insert ancient Greek texts with
diacritical characters into your document using the commonly
used Beta Code transliteration. You can directly insert Beta
Code texts -- as they can be found at the Perseus project, for
example -- without modification.
