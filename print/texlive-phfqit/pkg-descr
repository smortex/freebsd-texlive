This package provides macros to typeset some general
mathematical operators (identity operator, trace, diagonal,
rank, ...), a powerful implementation of the bra-ket notation
(kets, bras, brakets, matrix elements etc. which can be sized
as required), delimited expressions such as averages and norms,
and some basic Lie algebra/group names. Macros for entropy
measures for quantum information theory (smooth min- and max-
entropy, smooth relative entropies, etc.) are also provided.
