The bundle provides two packages: - xint, which provides
expandable TeX macros the basic arithmetic operations of
addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, as applied
to arbitrarily long numbers represented as chains of digits
with an optional minus sign; and - xintgcd, which provides
implementations of the Euclidean algorithm, and of its
typesetting. The packages may used both with Plain TeX and
LaTeX.
