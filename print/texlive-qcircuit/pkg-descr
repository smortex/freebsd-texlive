The package is designed for those within the quantum
information community who typeset quantum circuits. Based off
the xy-pic package, qcircuit contains a list of macros designed
to help users speedily generate circuits. qcircuit was
originally written by Bryan Eastin and Steven Flammia while
graduate students at the University of New Mexico, New Mexico,
USA. Recently, some students from this same university have
expressed an interest in rebooting the project to add
enhancements and other features needed by the quantum
information community.
