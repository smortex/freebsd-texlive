The package allows you to place a picture on the title page
(cover page) of a LaTeX document. Example of usage:
\usepackage[cc]{titlepic} \usepackage{graphicx}
\titlepic{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{picture.png}} The
package currently only works with the document classes article,
report and book.
