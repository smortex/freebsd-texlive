The package fixes the problem of TeX faiing to hyphenate letter
strings that seem (to TeX) to be words, but which are followed
by an apostrophe and then an emphasis command. The cause of the
problem is not the apostrophe, but the font change in the
middle of the string. The problem arises in Catalan, French and
Italian (it could arise in Romansh, were there LaTeX support
for it).
