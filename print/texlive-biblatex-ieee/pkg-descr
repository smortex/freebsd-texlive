This is a biblatex style that implements the bibliography style
of the IEEE for biblatex. The implementation follows standard
biblatex conventions, and can be used simply by loading
biblatex with the appropriate option:
\usepackage[style=ieee]{biblatex} A demonstration database is
provided to show how to format input for the style. The present
release is believed to be usable, but work is needed to confirm
that it is of production quality. (In particular, the release
does not employ the new facilities of biblatex version 1.2.)
