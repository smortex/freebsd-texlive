A LaTeX implementation of a combined FIFO Stack modified from
the existing stack package by Benjamin Bayart. The package
renames the original's \Push and \Pop commands \FSPush and
\FSPop, and which work on the top/end of the FIFO/Stack), and
adds the ability to \FSUnshift and \FSShift from the the
bottom(front) of the FIFO/Stack.
