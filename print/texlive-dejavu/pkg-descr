The package contains LaTeX support for the fonts DejaVu. They
are derived from the Vera fonts and contain more characters and
styles. The fonts are included in the original TrueType format
and converted Type 1 format. The (currently) supported
encodings are: OT1, T1, IL2, TS1, T2* and X2. The package
(currently) supports neither Greek nor math. More encodings
and/or features will come later.
