The package provides a means of producing beautiful song books
for church or fellowship. It offers: - a very easy chord-entry
syntax; - multiple modes (words-only; words+chords; slides;
handouts); - measure bars; - guitar tablatures; - automatic
transposition; - scripture quotations; - multiple indexes
(sorted by title, author, important lyrics, or scripture
references); and - projector-style output generation, for
interactive use. A set of example documents is provided.
