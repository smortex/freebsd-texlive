The eCards package for LaTeX enables you to create a series of
electronic (flash) cards. The document author provides
questions, hints and answers to a series of questions. Users
can test their knowledge by responding to the questions. The
questions are delivered in random order. eCards makes use of
the acroTeX bundle.
