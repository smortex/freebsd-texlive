The package provides a set of macros based on PSTricks to draw
medical pedigrees according to the recommendations for
standardized human pedigree nomenclature. The drawing commands
place the symbols on a pspicture canvas. An interface for
making trees is also provided. The package may be used both
with LaTeX and PlainTeX. A separate Perl program for generating
TeX files from spreadsheets is available.
