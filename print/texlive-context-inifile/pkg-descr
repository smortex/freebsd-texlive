The module parses an ini-file and prints the contents with a
user-defined layout. The entries of the file may be sorted by
up to three sort keys. The format of a simple ini-file would
be: [key1] symbol1 = value1 symbol2 = value2 [key2] symbol1 =
value3 symbol2 = value4 The module only works with ConTeXt
MkIV, and uses Lua to help process the input.
