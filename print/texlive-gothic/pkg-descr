A collection of fonts that reproduce those used in "old German"
printing. The set comprises Gothic, Schwabacher and Fraktur
fonts, a pair of handwriting fonts, Suetterlin and Schwell, and
a font containing decorative initials. In addition, there are
two re-encoding packages for Haralambous's fonts, providing T1,
using virtual fonts, and OT1 and T1, using Metafont.
