The build system supports testing and building LaTeX3 code, on
Linux, Mac OS X and Windows systems. The package offers: A unit
testing system for (La)TeX code (whether kernel code or
contributed packages); A system for typesetting package
documentation; and An automated process for creating CTAN
releases. The package is essentially independent of other
material released by the LaTeX3 team, and may be updated on a
different schedule.
