This package offers the user an easy way to typeset The Holy
Quran. It has been inspired by the lipsum and ptext packages
and provides several macros for typesetting the whole or any
part of Quran based on its popular division. Available macros
are: \quransurah, \quranayah, \quranjuz, \quranhizb,
\quranquarter, \quranpage, \qurantext, \surahname, \basmalah.
The package only works with the "xelatex" format and should be
loaded before the bidi package.
