The package defines two new commands \graphicxbox and
\fgraphicxbox, which are companions to \colorbox and \fcolorbox
of the Standard LaTeX color package. The \graphicxbox command
inserts a graphical image as a background rather than a
background color, while \fgraphicxbox does the same thing, but
also draws a colored frame around the box.
