This package provides a few tools to ease using fonts
(especially Truetype/Opentype ones) with Latex and fontinst:
AFM2AFM - reencode .afm files; designed to replace fontinst's
\reencodefont for big .afm files; AUTOINST - simplify the use
of the LCDF TypeTools by creating a command file for otftotfm,
plus .fd and .sty files; CMAP2ENC - convert glyph indices in
TrueType fonts without glyph names (such as Linotype Palatino)
to Adobe glyph names; FONT2AFM - create font metrics; this is
just a wrapper script around tools such as pf2afm, ttf2afm,
pfm2kpx and ot2kpx; OT2KPX - extract all kerning pairs from an
OpenType font; PFM2KPX - extract all kerning pairs from buggy
.pfm files (the ones where pf2afm complains ".notdef character
occurred among kern pairs"); and SHOWGLYPHS - create a pdf file
that shows all glyphs in a font. Please see the documentation
of the individual programs for further information.
