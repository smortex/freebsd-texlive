The purpose of this package is to draw the spectra of elements
in a simple way. It is based on the package pst-spectra,
supporting the same options, but also adding some new options.
It relies on PGF/TikZ for drawing the desired spectrum,
continuous or discrete. As in pst-spectra, there are data
available for the spectra of 99 elements and their ions (from
the NASA database). It also allows the user to draw spectra
using their own data.
