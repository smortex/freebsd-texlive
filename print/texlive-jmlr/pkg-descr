The jmlr bundle provides a class for authors (jmlr) and a class
for production editors (jmlrbook), as well as a script
makejmlrbook The jmlrbook class may can be used to combine
articles written using the jmlr class into a book. The jmlrbook
class uses the combine class and the hyperref package to
produce either a colour hyperlinked book for on-line viewing or
a greyscale nonhyperlinked book for printing. The makejmlrbook
Perl script can be used to create the colour hyperlinked and
greyscale nonhyperlinked PDFs of a document using the jmlrbook
class. It can also create a set of HTML files that list the
included papers with links to their abstracts and the
individual articles as PDFs.
