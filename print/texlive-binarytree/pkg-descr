The new 'binarytree' package provides an easy but flexible way
to draw binary trees using TikZ. A path specification and the
setting of various options determine the style for each edge of
the tree. There is support for the external library of TikZ
which does not affect externalization of the rest of the TikZ
figures in the document. There is an option to use automatic
file naming: useful if the trees are often moved around.
