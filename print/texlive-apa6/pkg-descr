The class provides a full set of facilities in three different
output modes (journal-like appearance, double-spaced
manuscript, LaTeX-like document), in contrast to the earlier
apa6e, which only formats double-spaced manuscripts in APA
style. The class formats documents in APA style (6th Edition).
It is built on the apa class (which is no longer maintained),
and has been updated to comply with 6th-Edition requirements.
The class can mask author identity for copies for use in masked
peer review.
