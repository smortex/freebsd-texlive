The package looks at all hyphenation breaks in the document,
comparing them against a white-list prepared by the author. If
a hyphenation break is found, for which there is no entry in
the white-list, the package flags the line where the break
starts. The author may then either add the hyphenation to the
white-list, or adjust the document to avoid the break.
