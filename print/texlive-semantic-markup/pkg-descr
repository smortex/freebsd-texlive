The package provides simple commands to allow authors
(especially scholars in the humanities) to write with a focus
on content rather than presentation. Commands like \term and
\foreign are aliases for \emph. \quoted and \soCalled are
aliases for quoting commands. These commands could be easily
redefined for different formats. The package also provides a
footnote environment so that long footnotes can be more cleanly
separated from the main text.
