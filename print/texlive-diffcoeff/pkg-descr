diffcoeff.sty allows the easy writing of ordinary and partial
differential coefficients of arbitrary order. For mixed partial
derivatives, the overall order (algebraic or numeric) is
calculated by the package. Optional arguments allow the easy
specification of a point of evaluation for ordinary
derivatives, or variables held constant for partial
derivatives, and the placement of the differentiand (in the
numerator or appended). Some tweaking of the display is
possible through key = value settings. Secondary commands
provide analogous coefficients constructed from D, \Delta and
\delta and a command for writing Jacobians. diffcoeffx.sty is
diffcoeff.sty 'on steroids', extending that package in ways
that are probably unnecessary but have a certain logical force.
The packages require the LaTeX3 bundles, l3kernel and
l3packages.
