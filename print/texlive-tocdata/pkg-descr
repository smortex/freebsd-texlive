The package may be used to add a small amount of data to an
entry in the table of contents or list of figures, between the
section name and the page number. The typical use would be to
add the name of an author or artist of a chapter or section,
such as in an anthology or a collection of papers.
Additionally, user-level macros are provided which add the
author's name to a chapter or section, along with an optional
prefix and/or suffix, and add to a figure the artist's name,
prefix, and suffix, plus optional additional text. Author and
artist names are also added to the index. Additional user-level
macros control formatting.
