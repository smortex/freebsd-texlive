The mathastext package propagates the document text font to
mathematical mode, for the letters of the Latin alphabet and,
optionally, other characters in the font. Thus it makes
possible (for a document with simple mathematics) to use a
quite arbitrary text font without worrying too much that no
specially designed accompanying maths fonts are available. The
package also offers a simple mechanism for using many different
choices of (text hence, now, math) font in the same document.
Of course, using one font for two purposes helps produce
smaller PDF files.
