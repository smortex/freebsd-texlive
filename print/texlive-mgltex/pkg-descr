This package allows you to create high-quality publication-
ready graphics directly from MGL scripts embedded into your
LaTeX document, using the MathGL library. Besides following the
LaTeX philosophy of allowing you to concentrate on content
rather than output (mglTeX takes care of producing the output),
mglTeX facilitates the maintenance of your document, since both
code for text and code for plots are contained in a single
file. MathGL. is a fast and efficient library by Alexey Balakin
for the creation of high-quality publication-ready scientific
graphics. Although it defines interfaces for many programming
languages, it also implements its own scripting language,
called MGL, which can be used independently.
