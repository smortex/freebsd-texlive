The xellipsis package provides a system for configuring
(almomst) every possible aspect of ellipses, including
preceding and proceeding characters; the character itself;
distances before and after each of these; and number of
characters. It comes with both a compatibility option for
standard LaTeX \ldots as well as preset package options for the
Chicago Manual of Style (Turabian); the Bluebook; and MLA
guidelines.
