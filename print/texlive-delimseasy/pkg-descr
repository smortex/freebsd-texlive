This package provides commands to give a consistent, easy-to-
remember, easy to edit way to control the size and blackness of
delimiters: append 1-4 "b"s to command for larger sizes;
prepend "B" for for boldface. These commands reduce the
likelihood of incomplete delimeter pairs and typically use
fewer characters than the LaTeX default.
