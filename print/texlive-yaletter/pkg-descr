The yaletter class provides extremely configurable macros for
typesetting letters in any conceivable style. It provides
facilities for maintaining easily-accessible databases of
letterheads and addresses for repeat use. It further provides
easy macros for envelopes and for label sheets. Finally, it
provides some nice defaults for a few of the more common styles
and sizes.
