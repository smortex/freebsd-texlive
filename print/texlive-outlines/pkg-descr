Defines an outline environment, which allows outline-style
indented lists with freely mixed levels up to four levels deep.
It replaces the nested begin/end pairs by different item tags
\1 to \4 for each nesting level. This is very convenient in
cases where nested lists are used a lot, such as for to-do
lists or presentation slides.
