The script extracts the preamble of the document and runs all
\begin{postscript}...\end{postscript}
\begin{pspicture}...\end{pspicture} and
\pspicture...\endpspicture separately through LaTeX with the
same preamble as the original document; thus it creates EPS,
PNG and PDF files of these snippets. In a final PDFLaTeX run
the script replaces the environments with \includegraphics to
include the processed snippets. Detail documentation is
acquired from the document itself via Perldoc.
