In "Die TeXnische Komodie" (in 2004) Christian Justen described
his use of LaTeX in his work as priest. One point was to
arrange A5 pages onto A4 landscape paper, either side-by-side
or as a booklet. Justen made two bash scripts for this job; the
package provides one texlua script for both requirements.
