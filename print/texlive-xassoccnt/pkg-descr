This package provides a way of associating counters to an
existing driver counter so that incrementing the driver counter
will increase its associated counters as well. This package can
be regarded as a supplement to the totcount package by
Vasileios Koutavas, but it can be used without it, too.
xassoccnt is a successor and a complete rewrite of the assoccnt
package by the same author. However, as of 2015/11/07, some
features of assoccnt are not (yet) contained in xassoccnt, so
that the older package cannot yet be regarded as obsolete.
