The package provides a single environment, tabu, which will
make any sort of tabular (that doesn't need to split across
pages). The package requires the array package, and needs e-TeX
to run (since array.sty is present in every conforming
distribution of LaTeX, and since every publicly available LaTeX
format is built using e-TeX, the requirements are provided by
default on any reasonable system). The tabu environment may be
used in place of tabular, tabular* and tabularx environments,
as well as array in maths mode. It overloads tabularx's X-
column specification, allowing a width specification, alignment
(l, r, c and j) and column type indication (p, m and b).
\begin{tabu} to <dimen> specifies a target width, and
\begin{tabu} spread <dimen> enlarges the environment's
"natural" width.
