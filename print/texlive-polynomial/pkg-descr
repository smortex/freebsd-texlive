The package offers an easy way to write (univariate)
polynomials and rational functions. It defines two commands,
one for polynomials \polynomial{coeffs} and one for rational
functions \polynomialfrac{Numerator}{Denominator}. Both
commands take lists of coefficients as arguments, and offer
limited optional behaviour.
