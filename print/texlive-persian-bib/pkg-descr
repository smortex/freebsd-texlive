Currently 7 files: unsrt-fa.bst, acm-fa.bst, ieeetr-fa.bst,
plain-fa.bst, asa-fa.bst, chicago-fa.bst and plainnat-fa.bst
are modified for Persian documents prepared with XePersian
(which the present package depends on). The Persian .bst files
can simultaneously handle both Latin and Persian references. A

references and three fields LANGUAGE, TRANSLATOR and AUTHORFA
are defined.
