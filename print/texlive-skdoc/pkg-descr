The class provides the functionality and implementation of
packages and document classes. It is loosely based on the ydoc
and ltxdoc classes, but has a number of incompatible
differences. The class defines a MacroCode environment which
offers an alternative to the the usual docstrip method of
installing packages. It has the ability to generate both
documentation and code in a single run of a single file.
