This is a versatile bundle of packages and classes for
consistent formatting of control sequences, package options,
source code examples, and writing a package manual (including
an index containing the explained control sequences, options,
ldots). The bundle also provides several other small ideas of
mine such as a mechansim for providing abbreviations etc. Not
at least it provides a number of programming tools. The
intention behind this bundle mainly is a selfish one:
documenting my own packages. The bundle contains an index style
file cnltx.ist that should be placed in a directory in a TDS
makeindex directory.
