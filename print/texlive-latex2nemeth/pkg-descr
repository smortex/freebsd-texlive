After many failed attempts to transcribe real math notes and
books to Braille/Nemeth in order to deal with a real situation
(blind student in Math Dept.), we decided to develop a new
program that follows a direct, from LaTeX to Braille/Nemeth,
approach. Other attempts (such as tex4ht) failed because they
all needed an extra step to go from xml to Braille, and this
step (say, with liblouis) produced incomprehensible output
(liblouis focuses in Office apps). Our main target was the
Greek language which is only Braille level 1, but English at
level 1 is supported as well. Simple pictures in PSTricks are
also supported in order to produce tactile graphics with
specialized equipment. Note that embossing will need
LibreOffice and odt2braille as this project does not deal with
embossers' drivers.
