The bundle is a small collection of styles for biblatex. It was
designed for citations in the Humanities, following the
guidelines of style of the institutes for the social sciences
of the Leibniz University Hannover/LUH (especially the
Institute of Political Science). The bundle depends on biblatex
(version 1.1 at least) and cannot be used without it.
