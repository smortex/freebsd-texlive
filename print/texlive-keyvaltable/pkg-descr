The main goal of the keyvaltable package is to offer means for
typesetting tables easily and yet still looking rather nicely
in a way that separates content from presentation and with re-
usable layout for tables of the same type. For this purpose,
the package provides the environment KeyValTable, which allows
one to typeset tables that have a previously defined column
layout and whose rows can be produced in a key-value fashion.
