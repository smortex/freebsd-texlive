The asypictureB package is an unofficial alternative to the
asymptote package for creating Asymptote pictures within a
latex source file. While it does not duplicate all the features
of the official package, it is more user-friendly in several
ways. Most notably, Asymptote errors are repackaged as LaTeX
errors, making debugging less of a pain. It also has a more
robust mechanism for identifying unchanged pictures that need
not be recompiled.
