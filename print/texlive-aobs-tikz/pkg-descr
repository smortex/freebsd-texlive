The package defines auxiliary TikZ styles useful for overlaying
pictures' elements in Beamer. The TikZ styles are grouped in a
library, overlay-beamer-styles which is automatically called by
the package itself. Users may either load just aobs-tikz or the
library; the latter method necessitates TikZ manual load.
