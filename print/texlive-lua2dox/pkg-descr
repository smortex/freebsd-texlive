The package extends the well-known C-like language autodoc
tool, doxygen, to read and document lua code. In use, you edit
and test your code and periodically run the autodoc tool to
update the documentation, which may be viewed via an html
browser. Autodoc tools can read the code well enough to find
function/... declarations and document them. If the code also
contains appropriatly formatted "magic comments", the tool can
use them to supplement the documentation. The package is a
first prototype of a planned TeX2DoX tool (in development),
which will process joint (La)TeX/lua documents.
