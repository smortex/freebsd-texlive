The asciilist provides the environments AsciiList and
AsciiDocList, which enable quickly typesetting nested lists in
LaTeX without having to type individual item macros or
opening/closing list environments. The package provides
auxiliary functionality for loading such lists from files and
provides macros for configuring the use of the list
environments and the appearance of the typeset results.
