This short package provides a flexible list-parsing macro with
the ability to configure the parsing character, as well as the
macro names in which the parsed list items are placed. The name
of the parsing macro is \getargs. It is a significant
improvement over similarly named macros in the same author's
stringstrings and readarray packages. It is the author's intent
to eventually have the parsers of those other packages point to
this package, to achieve a measure of uniformity.
