The Nimbus 2015 Core fonts added Greek and Cyrillic glyphs.
This package may be best suited as an add-on the a
comprehensive Times package, providing support for Greek and
Cyrillic. A new intermediate weight of NimbusMono (AKA Courier)
is provided, along with a narrower version which may be useful
for rendering code.
