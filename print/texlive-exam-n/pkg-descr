The class design offers: Direct support for collaborative
development of an exam, using a model in which a departmental
'exams convener' or 'exam chair' coordinates multiple authors
writing individual questions (the class file and associated
process is in regular use within a physics and astronomy
department). All of the 'traditional' exam paper features such
as sectioning, per-part running marks, 'Question n continued'
catchwords, and so on. Readily configured local adaptation.
