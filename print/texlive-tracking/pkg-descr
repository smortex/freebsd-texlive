Automatically adjust spaces between symbols in words or phrases
to fit them into a specified length. Any chain of symbols
(including spaces) in the current font may be treated. Commands
\track{<length>}{<string>} (add space <length>, which may be
<0, after each symbol of <string>),
\fittrack{<length>}{<string>} (make <string> fit into width
<length>, which may be smaller than the original width) and
\ratiotrack{<ratio>}{<string>} (as \fittrack, with <length>
replaced by <ratio> of the natural length of <string>).
