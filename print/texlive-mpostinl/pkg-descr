mpostinl is a LaTeX2e package which enables the embedding of
MetaPost figures within a LaTeX document. The package
automatically collects the embedded definitions and figures in
a .mp file, adds an appropriate LaTeX document structure, and
compiles it to .mps files. It also allows for various
configuration options to manage the generation of files and
compilation.
