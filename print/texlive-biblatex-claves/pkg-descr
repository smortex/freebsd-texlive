When studying antic and medieval literature, we may find many
different texts published with the same title, or, in contrary,
the same text published with different titles. To avoid
confusion, scholars have published claves, which are books
listing ancient texts, identifying them by an identifier -- a
number or a string of text. For example, for early
Christianity, we have the Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca, the
Clavis Apocryphorum Novi Testamenti and other claves. It could
be useful to print the identifier of a texts in one specific
clavis, or in many claves. The package allows us to create new
field for different claves, and to present all these fields in
a consistent way.
