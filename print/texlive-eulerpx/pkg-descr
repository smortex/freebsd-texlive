This package provides the "eulerpx" font, which started as a
hybrid of multiple other font packages, notably eulervm and
newpxmath. Its purpose is twofold: To use the eulervm symbols
for greek and latin, but the newpxmath font for braces and
brackets, and the text font for digits and operators; and to
make it easy to change between a sans and a serif font for the
digits and operators so that the font can be used seamlessly in
documents using both. This package was put together with the
intent to use it with the Palatino and Optima fonts, but it may
work with other combinations, too.
