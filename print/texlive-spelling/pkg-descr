The package aids spell-checking of TeX documents compiled with
the LuaTeX engine. It can give visual feedback in PDF output
similar to WYSIWYG word processors. The package relies on an
external spell-checker application to check spelling of a text
file and to output a list of bad spellings. The package should
work with most spell-checkers, even dumb, TeX-unaware ones.
