The doc package includes tools for describing macros and
environments in LaTeX source dtx format. This package adds
additional tools for describing booleans, lengths, counters,
keys, packages, classes, options, files, commands, arguments,
and other objects. Each item is given a margin tag similar to
\DescribeEnv, and is listed in the index by itself and also by
category. Each item may be sorted further by an optional class.
All index entries except code lines are hyperlinked.
Descriptions are best accompanied by examples, so the
environment dtxexample is provided. Contents are displayed
verbatim along with a caption and cross-referencing. They are
then \input and executed, and the result is shown.
