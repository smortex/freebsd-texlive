This package provides BibTeX related Perl libraries by Gerhard
Gossen, repacked by Boris Veytsman, for TeX Live and other TDS-
compliant distributions. The libraries are written in pure
Perl, so should work out of the box on any architecture. They
have been packaged here mostly for Boris Veytsman's BibTeX
suite, but can be used in any other Perl script.
