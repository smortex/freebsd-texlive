Repeating of math operators at the broken line and the new line
in inline equations is used in Cyrillic mathematical typography
(Russian for example), but unfortunately LaTeX does not provide
such an option. This package solves the problem by extending
ideas described in M. I. Grinchuk "TeX and Russian Traditions
of Typesetting", TUGboat 17(4) (1996) 385 and supports most of
LaTeX mathematical packages. See the documentation for details.
