The package provides a Perl script that converts a .sty file
(LaTeX package) to .dtx format (documented LaTeX source), by
surrounding macro definitions with macro and macrocode
environments. The macro name is automatically inserted as an
argument to the macro environemnt. Code lines outside macro
definitions are wrapped only in macrocode environments. Empty
lines are removed. The script should not be thought to be fool
proof and 100% accurate but rather as a good start to the
business of making a .dtx file from an undocumented style file.
It does not generate a complete .dtx file, just the code
section.
