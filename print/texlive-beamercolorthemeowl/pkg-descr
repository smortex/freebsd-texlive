This package provides a flexible dark or light colour theme
designed for maximum readability in environments where most
themes fall flat. Main features: Dark color theme for
presenting in low-light conditions. Optional light color theme
for presenting in bright ambient light. Redefines color names
"red", "green", "blue", "yellow" to values that are visible
when displayed by certain projectors, particularly those with a
very bright green channel and dim red and blue channels. This
behaviour can be optionally disabled, with the provided colours
also available as "OwlRed", "OwlGreen", etc.
