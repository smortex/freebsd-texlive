This package provides environments and commands for pairing
lines, bottom lines, and tagged lines, intended to be used in
particular for word-by-word glosses, translations, and
bibliographic attributions, respectively. This LaTeX package is
inspired by Marcel R. van der Goot's classic Plain TeX macros
in gloss.tex.
