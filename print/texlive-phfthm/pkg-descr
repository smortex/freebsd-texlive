This package provides enhanced theorem and proof environments
based on the amsthm original versions. It allows for hooks to
be placed, adds some default goodies and is highly
customizable. In particular, it can connect theorems to proofs,
automatically producing text such as "See proof on page XYZ"
and "Proof of Theorem 4: ...".
