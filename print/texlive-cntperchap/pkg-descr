This package stores values of counters (which have been
registered beforehand) on a per chapter base and provides the
values on demand in the 2nd LaTeX compilation run. In this way
it is possible to know how many sections etc. there are lying
ahead and to react to these counter values, if needed. This is
a preliminary version that has been tested with book.cls,
memoir.cls, and scrbook.cls. The packages assoccnt (by the same
author) and xparse are needed as well.
