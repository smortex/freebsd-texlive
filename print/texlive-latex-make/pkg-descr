This package provides several tools that aim to simplify the
compilation of LaTeX documents: LaTeX.mk: a Makefile snippet to
help compiling LaTeX documents in DVI, PDF, PS, ... format.
Dependencies are automatically tracked: one should be able to
compile documents with a one-line Makefile containing 'include
LaTeX.mk'. Complex documents (with multiple bibliographies,
indexes, glossaries, ...) should be correctly managed.
figlatex.sty: a LaTeX package to easily insert xfig figures
(with \includegraphics{file.fig}). It can interact with
LaTeX.mk so that the latter automatically invokes transfig if
needed. And various helper tools for LaTeX.mk This package
requires GNUmake (>= 3.81).
