This class is intended to be an interpretation of the mwbk
class which is a part of the mwcls package. The mwcls classes
are simple, yet powerful and customizable classes that allow
the end-user to customize the layout of headers, headings etc.
They also have the benefit of being more economic in space than
the most common LaTeX classes, while keeping a clear appearance
and a smooth flow.
