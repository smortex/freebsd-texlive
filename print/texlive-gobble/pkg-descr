The LaTeX package gobble includes several gobble macros not
included in the LaTeX kernel. These macros remove a number of
arguments after them, a feature regulary used inside other
macros. This includes gobble macros for optional arguments. The
LaTeX package gobble-user provides these macros at the user
level, i.e. using names without @ so that these can be used
without \makeatletter and \makeatother. The same macros are
provided inside .tex files for use with plain-TeX or other TeX
formats. However, the gobble macros for optional macros require
\@ifnextchar to be defined.
