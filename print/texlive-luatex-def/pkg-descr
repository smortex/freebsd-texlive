This first version of luatex.def is a modified version of
pdftex.def. This is only needed for LuaTeX releases from 0.87
on: it will not work with the version 0.80 in current TeX Live
and MiKTeX distributions but is being made available for
testing. If you have a test version of LuaTeX 0.88 you may use
this file via "\usepackage[luatex]{graphicx}".
