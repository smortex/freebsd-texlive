The package provides two user commands; one that performs
multiple expansions, and one that does multiple \expandafter
operations, in a single macro call. The package requires eTeX's
\numexpr command. The author suggests that the same effect
could be provided by use of the command variant mechanisms of
LaTeX 3 (see, for example, the interface documentation of the
experimental LaTeX 3 kernel).
