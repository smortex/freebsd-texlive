This class is an unofficial LaTeX implementation of the
standard model for curriculum vitae (the Europass CV) as
recommended by the European Commission. In 2013 a major
revision of the Europass CV came out, featuring a neater, more
compact and somewhat fancier layout. This class is an
implementation of the 2013 version of that layout.
