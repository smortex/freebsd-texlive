This package provides a tool to keep a master source,
consisting of different "chunks" intended for different
audiences. The tool allows to extract the versions intended for
different audiences and to incorporate the changes made in any
of these versions into the master document. This work was
commissioned by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,
United States Treasury.
