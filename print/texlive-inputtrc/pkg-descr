The package produces screen/log messages of the form '<current>
INPUTTING <next>' reporting LaTeX input commands (<current> and
<next> being file names). The message is indented to reflect
the level of input nesting. Tracing may be turned on and off,
and the unit of indentation may be adjusted. The implementation
somewhat resembles those of packages FiNK and inputfile.
