The package's principal command, \diagbox, takes two arguments
(texts for the slash-separated parts of the box), and an
optional argument with which the direction the slash will go,
and the box dimensions, etc., may vbe controlled. The package
also provides \slashbox and \backslashbox commands for
compatibility with the slashbox package, which it supersedes.
