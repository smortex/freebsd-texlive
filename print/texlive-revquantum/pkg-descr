This package provides a number of useful hacks to solve common
annoyances with the revtex4-1 package, and to define notation
in common use within quantum information. In doing so, it
imports and configures a number of commonly-available and used
packages, and where reasonable, provides fallbacks. It also
warns when users try to load packages which are known to be
incompatible with revtex4-1.
