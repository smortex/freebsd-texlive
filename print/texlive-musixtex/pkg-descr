MusiXTeX is a set of macros, based on the earlier MusicTeX, for
typesetting music with TeX. MusicTeX demonstrated that TeX
alone cannot practically typeset good-looking ties and slurs;
MusiXTeX therefore works with a separate processor (musixflx)
to generate the slurs. As a result, MusixTeX is a three-pass
system: TeX, musixflx, and TeX again. This version of MusixTeX
builds upon work by Andreas Egler, whose own version is no
longer being developed. Raw MusiXTeX macros are universally
acknowledged to be tricky to write: most users employ the pmx
preprocessor, which takes much of the strain. However, no-one
would claim that even pmx could serve as a 'composer's
workbench' -- among free software offerings, the composer is
probably best served by lilypond, and there are several good
(and very expensive) commercial packages.
