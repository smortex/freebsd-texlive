Some publishers organize book series with subseries. In this
case, two numbers are associated with one volume: the number
inside the series and the number inside the subseries. That is
the case of the series Corpus Scriptorium Christianorum
Orientalium published by Peeters. This package provides new
fields to manage such system.
