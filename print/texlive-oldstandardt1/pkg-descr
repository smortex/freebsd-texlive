This package provides LaTeX and pdfLaTeX support for the Old
Standard family of fonts, designed by Alexey Kryukov. Old
Standard reproduces a specific type of Modern (classicist)
style of serif typefaces, very commonly used in various
editions of the late 19th and early 20th century, but almost
completely abandoned later.
