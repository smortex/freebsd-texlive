The package offers macros for making posters and banners with
TeX. It is compatible with most TeX macro formats, including
Plain TeX, LaTeX, AmSTeX, and AmS-LaTeX. The package creates a
poster as huge box, which is then distributed over as many
printer pages as necessary. The only special requirement is
that your printer not be bothered by text that lies off the
page. This is true of most printers, including laser printers
and PostScript printers.
