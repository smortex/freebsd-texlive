This package provides the LaTeX environment listing, an
alternative to the built-in verbatim environment. The listing
environment is taylored for including listings of computer
program source code into documents. The main advantages over
the original verbatim environment are: - environments
automatically fixes leading whitespace so that the environment
and program listing can be indented with the rest of the
document source, and; listing environments may easily be
customised and extended.
