ArmTeX is a system for typesetting Armenian text with Plain TeX
or LaTeX(2e). It may be used with input: from a standard Latin
keyboard without any special encoding and/or support for
Armenian letters, any keyboard which uses an encoding that has
Armenian letters in the second half (characters 128-255) of the
extended ASCII table (for example ArmSCII8 Armenian standard),
or encoded in UTF-8. Users should note that the manuals (below)
mostly describe the previous (version 2.0) of the package.
Updating work is still under way.
