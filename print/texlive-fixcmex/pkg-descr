This package provides a fully scalable version of the Computer
Modern Math Extension font for curing sizing problems mainly
with lmodern. It can be used when the main font of the document
is Computer Modern (or European Modern, if T1 encoding is
selected), or Latin Modern. It redefines the math extension
font so that it becomes arbitrarily scalable, using the optical
size fonts provided by the AMS together with the original
cmex10 font.
