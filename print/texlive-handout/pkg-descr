In some fields of scholarship, a beamer does not offer good
support when giving a talk in a proceeding. For example, in
classical philology, the main sources are text, and it will be
better to distribute a handout to the audience with extracts of
the texts about which we will talk. The package supports
preparation of such handouts when writing the talk.
