The package includes an archive containing a MusiXTeX extension
library musixtnt and C source code, binaries for Windows (32
bit and 64 bit) and MacOSX, and documentation for two programs:
fixmsxpart and msxlint. musixtnt.tex provides a macro
\TransformNotes that enables transformations of the effect of
notes commands such as \notes. In general, the effect of
\TransformNotes{input}{output} is that notes commands in the
source will expect their arguments to match the input pattern,
but the notes will be typeset according to the output pattern.
An example is extracting single-instrument parts from a multi-
instrument score. fixmsxpart corrects note spacing in a single-
part MusiXTeX source (possibly derived from a multi-instrument
score and as a result having irregular note spacing). msxlint
detects incorrectly formatted notes lines in a MusiXTeX source
file. This should be used before using \TransformNotes.
