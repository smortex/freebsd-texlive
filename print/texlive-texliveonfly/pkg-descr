The package provides a script that performs 'on the fly'
downloads of missing packages, while a document is being
compiled. (This feature is already available in the MikTeX
distribution for Windows machines.) To use the script, replace
your (LaTeX) compilation command with texliveonfly.py file.tex
(default options are --engine=lualatex and --arguments="-
synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode", both of which may be
changed). The script is designed to work on Linux
distributions.
