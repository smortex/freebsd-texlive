The class provides a set of functionality for writing
"curriculum vitae" with different layouts. The idea is that a
user can write some custom configuration directives, by means
of which is possible both to produce different c.v. layouts and
quickly switch among them. In order to process such directives,
the class uses a set of lists, provided by the package
etextools. Basic support for using TikZ decorations is also
provided.
