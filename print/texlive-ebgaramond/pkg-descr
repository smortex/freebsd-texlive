EB Garamond is a revival by Georg Duffner of the 16th century
fonts designed by Claude Garamond. Currently only upright and
italic variants are available. As a stop-gap, this package
provides bold variants produced automatically by fontforge;
these are likely to be buggy, and font metrics will certainly
change when official bold variants become available. The LaTeX
support package works for (pdf)LaTeX, xeLaTeX and luaLaTeX
users.
