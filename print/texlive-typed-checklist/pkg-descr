The main goal of this package is to provide means for
typesetting checklists in a way that stipulates users to
explicitly distinguish checklists for goals, for tasks, for
artifacts, and for milestones -- i.e., the type of checklist
entries. The intention behind this is that a user of the
package is coerced to think about what kind of entries he/she
adds to the checklist. This shall yield a clearer result and,
in the long run, help with training to distinguish entries of
different types.
