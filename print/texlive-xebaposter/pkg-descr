The package is designed for making scientific posters. This
work is a fork of baposter by Brian Amberg and Reinhold
Kainhofer available at http://www.brian-amberg.de/uni/poster/.
The class should be used with bidi and xepersian packages,
because it uses some special environments and commands from
these packages.
