This class is a wrapper around the beamer class to make it
easier to use the same document to generate the different forms
of the presentation: the slides themselves, an abbreviated
slide set for transparencies or online reference, an n-up
handout version (various layouts are provided), and a
transcript or set of notes using the article class. The class
provides a variety of handout layouts, and allows the mode to
be chosen from the command line (without changing the document
itself).
