Grid setting -- also known as strict in-register setting -- is
something, that should be done for a lot of documents but is
not easy using LaTeX. The package helps to get the information
needed for grid setting. It does not implement auto grid
setting, but there is a command \vskipnextgrid, that moves to
the next grid position. This may be enough under some
circumstances, but in other circumstances it may fail. Thus
gridset is only one more step for grid setting, not a complete
solution.
