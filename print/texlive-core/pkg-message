************************************************************************
* The FreeBSD TeXLive ports are split in a HUGE number of ports.  To
  ease up installing, you are advised to install so called 'schemes'
  (available as print/texlive-scheme-*) and 'collections' (provided by
  print/texlive-collection-*);

* If you don't know exactly which TeXLive packages you need, you are
  strongly advised to install the print/texlive-scheme-full port to
  install a complete TeXLive system;

* Each addition or removal of a TeXLive package require mktexlsr to be
  run as root to update the list of files available to the document
  processor.  This is done automatically by default, but can take a LONG
  time if you have many TeXLive packages installed, so you might want
  to disable this feature defining WITHOUT_TEXLIVE_MKTEXLSR and run it
  manually (you will be kindly reminded to do so by the ports system).
