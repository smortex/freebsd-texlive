Preloading hyphenation patterns (or 'hyphen rules.) into any
format based upon LuaTeX is not required in LuaTeX and recent
releases of babel don't do it anyway. This package is addressed
to those who just want to select the languages and load their
patterns by means of `language.dat` without loading `babel`.
