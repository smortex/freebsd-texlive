This package simplifies the process of writing Bangla in LaTeX
and addresses most of the associated typesetting issues.
Notable features: Automated transition from Bangla to English
and vice versa. Patch for the unproportionate whitespace issue
in popular Bangla fonts. Full support for all the common
commands and environments. Bangla numbering for page, section,
chapter, footnotes etc. (extending polyglossia's support). New
theorem, problems, example, solution and other environments,
all of which are in Bangla.
