The package defines \pstODEsolve for solving initial value
problems for sets of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)
using the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF45) method with automatic
step size adjustment. The result is stored as a PostScript
object and may be plotted later using macros from other
PSTricks packages, such as \listplot (pst-plot) and
\listplotThreeD (pst-3dplot), or may be further processed by
user-defined PostScript procedures. Optionally, the computed
state vectors can be written as a table to a text file.
