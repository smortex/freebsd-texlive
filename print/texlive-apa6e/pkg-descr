This is a minimalist class file for formatting manuscripts in
the style described in the American Psychological Association
(APA) 6th edition guidelines. Perhaps someday the established
(and more capable) apa class will gain support for the 6th
edition of the APA guidelines, in which case users should
probably use it instead. But in the mean time, this class may
be useful.
