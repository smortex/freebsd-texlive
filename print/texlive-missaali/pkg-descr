This package contains the free OpenType Textura font Missaali
and a style file for using it with XeLaTeX. Textura is a
typeface based on the textus quadratus form of the textualis
formata that late medieval scribes used for the most valuable
manuscripts. The font Missaali is based on Textura that German
printer Bartholomew Ghotan used for printing missals and
psalters in the 1480s. This font has two intended use cases: as
a Gothic display font; and for emulating late-medieval
manuscripts. In addition to the basic textura letters, the font
contains a large number of abbreviation sigla as well as a set
of Lombardic initials. As modern typesetting algorithms are not
intended for creating 15th century style layout, the package
contains a XeLaTeX style file that makes it easier to achieve
the classic incunabula look.
