Biber is a BibTeX replacement for users of biblatex. The
present release was developed for use with biblatex 1.2. Biber
reads UTF-8 input, and by default produces UTF-8 output, though
it can produce LaTeX accent-command-letter combinations if
required. Note: biber is formally named "biblatex-biber", to
distinguish it from an earlier (now apparently moribund)
project called "biber".
