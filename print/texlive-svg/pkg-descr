The package provides a command similar to \includegraphics
command of the graphicx package, which enables the inclusion of
SVG images using Inkscape. \includesvg[options]{svg filename} A
variety of options is available, including width, height, and
path of the SVG. The image is converted to an appropriate
format, using the \write18 mechanism to execute a shell
command, and the package also offers the means of saving a PDF,
EPS, or PNG copy of the image, at the same time. The
documentation shows an example using an SVG created from the
high energy particle physics analysis package ROOT.
