The ffslides ("freeform slides") class is intended to make it
easier to place various types of content freely on the page,
and therefore easier to design documents with a strong visual
component: presentations, posters, research or lecture notes,
and so on. The goal of the class is to be less rigid and less
complex than some of the popular presentation-making options.
It is essentially a small set of macros added to the article
class. A well-organized template file is included, and the
documentation is itself an extensive example of the class's
capabilities.
