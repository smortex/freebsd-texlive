The proofread package defines a few LaTeX commands that are
useful when you proofread a LaTeX document. These allow you to
easily highlight text and add comments in the margin. Vim
escape sequences are provided for inserting these LaTeX
commands in the source. The package is based on code for a text
highlighting command that was published by Antal S-Z in
href='http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/5959'. The main
file, proofread.dtx, is self-extracting, so you can generate
the style file by compiling proofread.dtx with pdfLaTeX.
