The calculation environment formats reasoned calculations, also
called calculational proofs. The notion of reasoned
calculations or calculational proofs was originally advocated
by Wim Feijen and Edsger Dijkstra. The package accepts options
fleqn and leqno (with the same effect as LaTeX options fleqn
and leqno, and inherits these from the document class). It
allows steps and expressions to be numbered (by LaTeX equation
numbers, obeying the LaTeX \label command to refer to these
numbers), and a step doesn't take vertical space if its hint is
empty. An expression in a calculation can be given a comment;
it is placed at the side opposite to the equation numbers.
Calculations are allowed inside hints although numbering and
commenting is then disabled.
