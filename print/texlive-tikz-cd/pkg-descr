The general-purpose drawing package TiKZ can be used to typeset
commutative diagrams and other kinds of mathematical pictures,
generating high-quality results. The purpose of this package is
to make the process of creation of such diagrams easier by
providing a convenient set of macros and reasonable default
settings. This package also includes an arrow tip library that
match closely the arrows present in the Computer Modern
typeface.
