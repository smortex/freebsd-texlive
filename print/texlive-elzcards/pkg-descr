A class, based on article.cls, for typesetting business cards,
index cards, and flash cards in an easy and flexible way,
optionally also the reverse side. You will have to furnish the
paper size, the desired size of your card, the printable area
of your printer, and the design of the card. Everything else is
taken care of by elzcards.
