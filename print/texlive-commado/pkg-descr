The bundle provides two packages: commado and filesdo. The
package commado provides the command \DoWithCSL:
\DoWithCSL{cmd}{list} applies an existing one-parameter macro
cmd to each item in a list list in which terms are separated by
commas. The package filesdo provides the command
\DoWithBasesExts: \DoWithBasesExts{cmd}{bases}{exts} which runs
the single parameter command cmd on each file whose base and
extension are respectively from the comma-separated lists bases
and exts. These 'loop'-like commands are (themselves) entirely
expandable. The packages rely on packages plainpkg, and
stacklet
