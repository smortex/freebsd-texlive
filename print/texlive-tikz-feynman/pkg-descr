This is a is a LaTeX package allowing Feynman diagrams to be
easily generated within LaTeX with minimal user instructions
and without the need of external programs. It builds upon the
TikZ package and leverages the graph placement algorithms from
TikZ in order to automate the placement of many vertices. tikz-
feynman still allows fine-tuned placement of vertices so that
even complex diagrams can still be generated with ease.
