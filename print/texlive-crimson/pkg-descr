This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX, and LuaLaTeX
support for the Crimson family of fonts, designed by Sebastian
Kosch. The Crimson family is for book production in the
tradition of beautiful oldstyle typefaces, inspired
particularly by the work of people like Jan Tschichold (Sabon),
Robert Slimbach (Arno, Minion), and Jonathan Hoefler (Hoefler
Text). Support for small caps and old-style numerals is still
"under construction"; these features are not supported by this
version of the package.
