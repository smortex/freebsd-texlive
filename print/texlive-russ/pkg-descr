The package aims to facilitate Russian typesetting (based on
input using MicroSoft Code Page 1251). Russian hyphenation is
selected, and various mathematical commands are set up in
Russian style. Furthermore all Cyrillic letters' catcodes are
set to "letter", so that commands with Cyrillic letters in
their names may be defined.
