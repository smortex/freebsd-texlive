This program simplifies the creation of MusiXTeX scores by
converting (non-standard) commands of the form \anotes ... \en
into one or more conventional note-spacing commands, as
determined by the note values themselves, with \sk spacing
commands inserted as necessary. The coding for an entire
measure can be entered one part at a time, without concern for
note-spacing changes within the part or spacing requirements of
other parts. For example, \anotes\qa J\qa K&\ca l\qa m\ca n\en
generates \Notes\qa J\sk\qa K\sk&\ca l\qa m\sk\ca n\en .
