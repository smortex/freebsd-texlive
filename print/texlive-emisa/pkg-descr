The EMISA LaTeX package is provided for preparing manuscripts
for submission to EMISA, and for preparing accepted submissions
for publication as well as for typesetting the final document
by the editorial office. Articles in EMISA are published online
at EMISA (in the Portable Document Format or PDF format).
