This package augments the fancyvrb and listings packages to
allow the source code they contain to be checked by an external
tool (like a compiler). The external tool's messages can be
automatically reincorporated into the original document. The
package does not focus on a specific programming language, but
it is designed to work well with languages and compilers in the
ML family.
