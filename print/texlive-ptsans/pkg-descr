This package contains LaTeX support for the font PT Sans
developed by ParaType for the project "public Types of Russian
Federation", and released under an open user license. The fonts
are included in this distribution, in TrueType format (only:
note that use of such fonts with TeX and pdfTeX is not
trivial). The fonts provide coverage of the T2* and X2
encodings, and partial coverage of T1.
