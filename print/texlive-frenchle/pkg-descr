This is a light (and free) version of the excellent (shareware)
French Pro package for LaTeX, a package to typeset French
documents according to the rules of the "Imprimerie Nationale".
The package comprises three LaTeX files (plus documentation,
etc.): frenchle.sty is for use in a French-only document, while
frenchle.ldf is for use as a babel language file (utilised by
\usepackage[frenchle]{babel}; note that babel itself no longer
permits such usage, but the babelfr.sty package in this
distribution makes it possible).
