This package allows you to typeset pseudocode in the style of
Introduction to Algorithms, Third edition, by Cormen,
Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein. The package was written by the
authors. Use the commands the same way the package's author did
when writing the book, and your output will look just like the
pseudocode in the text.
