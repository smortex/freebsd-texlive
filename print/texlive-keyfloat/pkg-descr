The keyfloat package provides a key/value user interface for
quickly creating figures with a single image each, figures with
arbitrary contents, tables, subfloats, rows of floats, and
floats [H]. Key/value combinations may specify a caption and
label, a width proportional to \linewidth, a fixed width and/or
height, rotation, scaling, a tight or loose frame, an
\arraystretch, a continued float, additional supplemental text,
and an artist/author's name with automatic index entry. When
used with the tocdata package, the name also appears in the
List of Figures. Floats may be placed into a row environment,
and are typeset to fit within the given number of columns,
continuing to the next row if necessary. Nested sub-rows may be
used to generate layouts such as two small figures placed
vertically next to one larger figure. Subfloats are supported
by two environments.
