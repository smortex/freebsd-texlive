A package for typesetting scholarly critical editions,
replacing the established ledmac and eledmac packages. Ledmac
itself was a LaTeX port of the plain TeX EDMAC macros. The
package supports indexing by page and by line numbers, and
simple tabular- and array-style environments. The package is
distributed with the related reledpar package.
