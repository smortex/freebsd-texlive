The package provides a relatively easy way of estimating the
number of words in a LaTeX document that does not require
dvitty or other DVI converters. It does however require
something like Unix grep -c that can search a file for a
particular string and report the number of matching lines. An
accompanying shell script wordcount.sh contains more
information in its comments.
