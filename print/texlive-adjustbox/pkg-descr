The package provides the macros \trimbox, \clipbox and
\adjustbox as addition to the macros \resizebox, \scalebox and
\rotatebox from the graphics package. The package reuses the
"key=value" interface of the graphicx package. The pgf package
is used to implement the trimming and clipping operations as
well as to parse the numeric values. Environment versions of
the macros are also provided. Both macros and environments
support verbatim content.
