The package provides the means to use PDF drawing primitives to
produce high quality, colored graphics. It - uses Bezier curves
(integral and rational) from degree one to seven, - allows TeX
typesetting in the graphic, - offers most of the standard math
functions, - allows plotting normal, parametric and polar
functions. The package has linear, logx, logy, logxy and polar
grids with many specs; - it can rotate, clip and do many nice
things easily - it has two looping commands for programming and
many instructive example files. The package requires pdfTeX but
otherwise only depends on the calc package.
