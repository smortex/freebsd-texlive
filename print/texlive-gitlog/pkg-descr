This package allows git change log history to be incorporated
into LaTeX documents; the log data is obtained from the git
distributed version control system. The current release
(0.0.beta) is a proof-of-concept release to allow users an
early evaluation and to attract ideas and support. Requests and
suggestions, as well as code contributions are welcome.
