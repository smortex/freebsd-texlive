This small library provides a standard set of environments for
writing minimization problems. It automatically aligns the
problems in three points with an optional fourth: Beginning of
the words "minimize/argmin" and "subject to" The objective
function and the longest left hand side of the constraints The
$= | > | <$ signs of the constraints. Optionally, the user can
add manually a double align character && to align some common
constraints feature. A clear example could be the constraints
names, e.g. (boundary constraint) alignment with (dynamic
constraint). Furthermore, it provides an easy interface to
define optimization problem for three different reference
situations: Where no equation is referenced/numbered. Where the
problem is referenced with a single number. Where each equation
has an individual reference. Finally, it also allows a
definition of any optimization problem without a limitless
number of constraints.
