The FreeBSD TeXLive repository is automatically updated each night at 4.30am UTC.  The process is generaly less than one hour long, so the repository is generaly updated before 5.30 UTC.

# Updating the ports tree #

Run `portshaker` without argument to update and merge to your local Ports Tree both FreeBSD _official_ ports and FreeBSD TeXLive ports:

```
# portshaker
```

# Updating ports #

Update your ports as usual using `portmaster` or `portupgrade`.
