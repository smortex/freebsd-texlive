This package is intended to print a term calendar for use in
planning a class. It has a flexible mechanism for specifying
which days of the week are to be included and for inserting
text either regularly on the same day each week, or on selected
days, or for a series of consecutive days. It also has a
flexible mechanism for specifing class and nonclass days. Text
may be inserted into consecutive days so that it automatically
flows around nonclass days.
