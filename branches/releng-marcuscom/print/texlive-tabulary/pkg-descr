The package defines a tabular*-like tabulary environment,
taking a "total width" argument as well as the column
specifications. It then defines column types L, C, R and J for
variable width columns (\raggedright', \centering, \raggedleft,
and normally justified). In contrast to tabularx's X columns,
the width of each column is weighted according to the natural
width of the widest cell in the column.
