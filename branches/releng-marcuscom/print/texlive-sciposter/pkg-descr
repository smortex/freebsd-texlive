This collection of files contains LaTeX packages for posters of
ISO A3 size and larger (ISO A0 is the default size). American
paper sizes and custom paper are supported. In particular,
sciposter.cls defines a document class which allows cutting and
pasting most of an article to a poster without any editing
(save reducing the size) â€” see the manual. Sciposter does
work for LaTeX, not just pdfLaTeX. However, xdvi produces
strange results, though a recent version of dvips does create
good ps-files from the dvi files. Also note that logos must
either be put in the current working directory or in the
directories of your LaTeX distribution. For some reason
graphicspath settings are ignored.
