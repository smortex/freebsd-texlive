The xpackages is a bundle of prototype implementations of new
concepts for a LaTeX Designer Interface. The bundle contains: -
ldcsetup, which establishes an environment for the other
packages; - template and xtemplate, which define template
functions from which instances may be derived; and - xparse,
which permits flexible specifications of command arguments. In
addition, the package l3keys2e provides an interface whereby
LaTeX 2e programs may use the experimental LaTeX 3 keys
package, l3keys.
