Plotting numeric data is a task which has often to be done for
scientific papers. LaTeX itself provides no facilities for
drawing more than the simplest plots from supplied data. The
package will process user input, and uses PSTricks to plot the
results. The package provides Matlab functions to transform
Matlab results to plottable data.
