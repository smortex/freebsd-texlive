The package simulates typical word processor layout: narrow
page margins, Times, Helvetica and Courier fonts, \LARGE or
\Large headings, and \sloppy typesetting. The package aims at
making life easier for users who are discontent with LaTeX's
standard layout settings because they need a layout that
resembles the usual "wordlike" output. The design of the
package draws on several discussions in the de.comp.text.tex
and comp.text.tex newsgroups that are referred to in the
manual.
