Guit provides some commands useful to correctly write the logo
of "Gruppo Utilizzatori Italiani di TeX" (Italian TeX User
Group), using the default document color or any other color the
user may ever choose, in conformity with logo's scheme as seen
on the Group web site (http://www.guit.sssup.it). Likewise,
commands are provided that simplify the writing of GuIT
acronym's complete expansion, of the addresses of Group's
internet site and public forum and 'GuITmeeting' logo.
Optionally, using hyperref, the outputs of the above cited
commands can become hyperlinks to Group's site. Documentation
is available in Italian, only.
