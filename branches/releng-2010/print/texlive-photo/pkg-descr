This package introduces a new float type called photo which
works similar to the float types table and figure. Various
options exist for placing photos, captions, and a
"photographer" line. In twocolumn documents, a possibility
exists to generate double-column floats automatically if the
photo does not fit into one column. Photos do not have to be
placed as floats, they can also be placed as boxes, with
captions and photographer line still being available.
