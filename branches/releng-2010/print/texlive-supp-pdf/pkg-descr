The supp-pdf.* files support native MetaPost graphics inclusion
in LaTeX (via pdftex.def) and ConTeXt.  They can be used
independently of the rest of the ConTeXt, yet are maintained as
part of it.  So in TeX Live we pull them out to this separate
package for the benefit of LaTeX users who do not install the
rest of ConTeXt.  They can be found on CTAN in
macros/pdftex/graphics.
