Changing the size of the typeset area is well-known to be a
dangerous operation in TeX documents. This package identifies
the circumstances where the \geometry command of the geometry
package may safely be used, (other, of course, than in the
preamble of a document) and provides a mechanism for using it.
The package makes use of the author's gmutils package.
