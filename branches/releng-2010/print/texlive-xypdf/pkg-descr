The package improves the output quality of the Xy-pic package
when PDF documents are generated. It produces generic PDF code
for graphical elements like lines, curves and circles instead
of approximating these elements with glyphs in special fonts as
the original Xy-pic package does. The xypdf package works both
with pdfLaTeX and with compilation using LaTeX and dvipdfmx.
