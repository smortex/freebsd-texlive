The bundle provides: - General lua language functionality
(package luaextra) provided by the LuaTeX team (and imported,
here, from the ConTeXt distribution); - The means (package
luamcallbacks) to register functions in LuaTeX callbacks,
providing macros and a lua source file; and - General
extensions (package luatextra), incorporating an extended
version of the e-TeX register extensions package, support for
lua attributes, and provision of a module system, modelled on
the LaTeX package management functions.
