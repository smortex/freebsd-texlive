This is a fairly complete biblatex style (citations and
references) for APA (American Psychological Association)
publications. It implements and automates most of the
guidelines in the APA 5th edition style guide for citations and
references with a few (documented) exceptions (which are mainly
currently impossible to automate in principle for any BibTeX-
backed system). An example document is also given which typsets
every citation and reference example in the APA 5th edition
style guide.
