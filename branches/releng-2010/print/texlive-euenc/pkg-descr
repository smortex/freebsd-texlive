Font encoding definitions for unicode fonts loaded by LaTeX in
XeTeX. The package provides two encodings: EU1, designed for
use with XeTeX, which the fontspec uses for unicode fonts which
require no macro-level processing for accents, and EU2, which
provides the same facilities for use with LuaTeX. Neither
encoding places any restriction on the glyphs provided by a
font. The package includes font definition files for use with
the Latin Modern OpenType fonts.
