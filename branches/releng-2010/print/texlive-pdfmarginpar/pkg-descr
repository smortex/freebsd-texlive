The package provides the \pdfmarginpar command which is similar
in spirit to \marginpar. However, it creates PDF annotations
which can be viewed with Adobe Reader in place of text marginal
texts. Small icons indicate the in-text position where the
message originates, popups provide the messages themselves.
Thus bugfixes and other such communication are clearly visible
together with its text source, while the document itself is not
obscured.
