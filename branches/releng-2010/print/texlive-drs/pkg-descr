The package draws Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs).
It can draw embedded DRSs, if-then conditions and
quantificational "duplex conditions" (with a properly scaled
connecting diamond). Formatting parameters allow the user to
control the appearance and placement of DRSs, and of DRS
variables and conditions. The package is based on DRS macros in
the covington package.
