MathsPIC(Perl) is a development of the earlier MathsPIC(DOS)
program, now implemented as a Perl script, being much more
portable than the earlier program. MathsPIC parses a plain text
input file and generates a plain text output-file containing
commands for drawing a diagram. Version 1.0 produces output
containing PiCTeX and (La)TeX commands, which may then be
processed by plain TeX or LaTeX in the usual way. MathsPIC also
outputs a comprehensive log-file. MathsPIC facilitates creating
figures using PiCTeX by providing an environment for
manipulating named points and also allows the use of variables
and maths (advance, multiply, and divide)--in short--it takes
the pain out of PiCTeX. Both the original DOS version and the
new Perl version are available.
