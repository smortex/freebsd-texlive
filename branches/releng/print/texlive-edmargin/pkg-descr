Edmargin provides a very simple scheme for endnote sections for
critical editions. Endnotes can either be marked in the text,
or with marginal references to the page in the note sections
where the note is to be found. Notes can be set in individual
paragraphs, or in block paragraph mode (where there are many
short notes). Note sections will have running headers of the
form "Textual notes to pp. xx--yy". New note sections can be
created on the fly. There are predefined endnote sections for
textual notes, emendations, and explanatory notes.
