This package provides a macro (\includecombinedgraphics) for
the inclusion of combined EPS/LaTeX and PDF/LaTeX graphics (an
export format of Gnuplot, Xfig, and maybe other programs).
Instead of including the graphics with a simple \input, the
\includecombinedgraphics macro has some comforts: - changing
the font and color of the text of the LaTeX part; - rescaling
the graphics without affecting the font of the LaTeX part; -
automatic inclusion of the vector graphics part, as far as
LaTeX part does not do it (e.g., for files exported from
Gnuplot before version 4.2); and - rescaling and rotating of
complete graphics (similar to \includegraphics from the
graphicx package).
