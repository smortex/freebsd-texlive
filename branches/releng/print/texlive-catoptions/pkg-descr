The package changes package loading internals so that all
subsequently loaded packages can rely on normal/standard
catcodes of all ASCII characters. The package defines canonical
control sequences to represent all the visible ASCII
characters. It also provides robust options parsing mechanisms,
in addition to many other TeX programming tools.
