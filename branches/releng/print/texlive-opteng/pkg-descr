With this template, and associated style and LaTeX packages, it
is possible to estimate the page length of manuscripts for
submission to the SPIE journals 'Optical Engineering' and
'Optical Engineering Letters'. With a strict three-page limit,
this is particularly important for the latter. The template
gives simple instructions on how to prepare the manuscript.
