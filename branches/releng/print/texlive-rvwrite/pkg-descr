The package addresses, for LaTeX documents, the severe
limitation on the number of output streams that TeX provides.
The package uses a single TeX output stream, and writes
"marked-up" output to this stream. The user may then post-
process the marked-up output file, using LaTeX, and the
document's output appears as separate files, according to the
calls made to the package. The output to be post-processed uses
macros from the widely-available ProTeX package.
