The package aims to solve the error "No room for a new \write",
which occurs when the user, or when the user's packages have
'allocated too many streams using \newwrite (TeX has a fixed
number - 16 - such streams built-in to its code). The package
hooks into TeX primitive commands associated with writing to
files; it should be loaded near the beginning of the sequence
of loading packages for a document. The package uses the
l3kernel bundle.
