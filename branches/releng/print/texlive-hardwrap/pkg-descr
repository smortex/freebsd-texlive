The package facilitates wrapping text to a specific character
width, breaking lines by words rather than, as done by TeX, by
characters. The primary use for these facilities is to aid the
generation of messages sent to the log file or console output
to display messages to the user. Package authors may also find
this useful when writing out arbitary text to an external file.
