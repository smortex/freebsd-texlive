Petri-nets is a set of TeX/LaTeX packages about Petri nets and
related models. Three packages are available: - the first
allows the user to draw Petri-nets in PostScript documents; -
the second defines macros related to PBC, M-nets and B(PN)
models; and - the last gathers together the previous two.
