The package provides a simple interface to OpenStreetMap maps.
In the simplest case, it is sufficient to specify the address
you need (if you don't, the package will use its own default).
The package loads the map image using an external lua script
(invoked via \write 18: LaTeX must be running with \write 18
enabled). The ("external") lua script may be used from the
command line; a bash version is provided.
