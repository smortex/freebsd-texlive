The package is an extension for the listings package that
provides a source code printer for LaTeX. This package defines
new language definitions and listing environments for the three
language dialects of the Vienna Development Method: VDM-SL,
VDM-PP and VDM-RT. If one wants to typeset VDM with a
mathematical syntax instead of the ASCII syntax used here one
should use the vdm pacakge instead
