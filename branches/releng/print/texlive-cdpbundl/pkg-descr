The C.D.P. Bundle can be used to typeset high-quality business
letters formatted according to Italian style conventions. It is
highly configurable, and its modular structure provides you
with building blocks of increasing level, by means of which you
can compose a large variety of letters. It is also possible to
write letters divided into sections and paragraphs, to include
floating figures and tables, and to have the relevant indexes
compiled automatically. A single input file can contain several
letters, and each letter will have its own table of contents,
etc., independant from the other ones.
