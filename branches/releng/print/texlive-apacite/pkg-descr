Apacite is a BibTeX style which closely follows American
Psychological Association style citations, providing a very
good match. The package follows the the 5th edition of the APA
manual, and provides up to date documentation and a test
document. The package is compatible with chapterbib and (to
some extent) with hyperref (for limits of compatibility, see
the manual). The package also includes a means of generating an
author index for a document.
