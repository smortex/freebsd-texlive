The package enables the user to produce and typeset one or more
indexes simultaneously with a document. The package is known to
work in LaTeX documents processed with pdflatex, xelatatex and
lualatex. If makeindex is used for processing the index
entries, no particular setting up is needed when TeX Live 2010
is used. Using xindy or other programs it is necessary to
enable shell escape; shell escape is also needed if splitindex
is used.
