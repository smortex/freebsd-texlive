The Songbook package provides an all purpose songbook style for
LaTeX2e. The package allows for three types of output from a
single input file: words and chords books for the musicians to
play from, words only songbooks for the congregation to sing
from, and overhead transparency masters for congregational use.
The package will also print a table of contents, an index
sorted by title and first line, and an index sorted by key, or
by artist/composer. The package attempts to handle songs in
multiple keys, as well as songs in multiple languages.
