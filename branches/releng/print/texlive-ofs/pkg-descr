OFS (Olsak's Font System) is a set of Plain TeX and LaTeX
macros for managing large font collections; it has been used by
Czech/Slovak users for many years. Main features include: -
Mapping from long names of fonts to the metric file name. The
user can specify only exact long names in documents. - Support
for many font encodings. - Printing of catalogues of fonts and
test samples of font families; the interactive macro \showfonts
shows all font families you have installed via OFS. - The user
interface is the same for Plain TeX and for LaTeX, but the
implementation differs: the LaTeX variant of OFS uses NFSS, but
the Plain variant implements its own font management (which may
even be better than NFSS) - Support for math fonts including TX
fonts.
