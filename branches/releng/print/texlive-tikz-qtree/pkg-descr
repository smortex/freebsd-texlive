The package provides a macro for drawing trees with TikZ using
the easy syntax of Alexis Dimitriadis' Qtree. It improves on
TikZ's standard tree-drawing facility by laying out tree nodes
without collisions; it improves on Qtree by adding lots of
features from TikZ (for example, edge labels, arrows between
nodes); and it improves on pst-qtree in being usable with
pdfTeX and XeTeX.
