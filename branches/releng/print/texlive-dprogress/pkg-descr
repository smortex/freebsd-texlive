The package logs LaTeX's progress through the file, making the
LaTeX output more verbose. This helps to make LaTeX debugging
easier, as it is simpler to find where exactly LaTeX failed.
The package outputs the typesetting of section, subsection and
subsubsection headers and (if amsmath is loaded) details of the
align environment.
