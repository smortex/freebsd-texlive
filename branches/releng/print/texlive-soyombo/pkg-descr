The package provides the Soyombo script and the Soyombo symbol
for LaTeX users. The script and the symbol were both developed
in 1686 by the Mongolian monk and scholar Zanabazar. Soyombo
script is modelled after Lantsa-Devanagari, and it combines the
phonemic repertoire of Mongolian, Sanskrit, and Tibetan. While
the script is now little used, the symbol appears very widely
(including the national flag).
