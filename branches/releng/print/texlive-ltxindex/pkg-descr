A LaTeX package that allows the user to make indexes with GNU's
Texindex program, instead of makeindex. It provides the
indexing commands available in Texinfo by default, but only
defines the concept index (cp) by default -- the user must
define other standard indexes, and there is no provision for
custom indexes. The package is not currently maintained.
