The use of formats helps to speed up compilations: packages
which have been dumped in the format are loaded at very high
speed. This is useful when a document loads many packages
(including large packages such as pgf-TikZ). The package was
largely developed on the basis of mylatex, and eliminates many
of the limitations and problems of that package.
