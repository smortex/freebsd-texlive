Philex provides means for creating and cross-referencing named
or numbered environments. Possible uses would be equations,
example sentences (as in linguistics or philosophy) or named
principles. Cross references may refer either to the number, or
to a short name of the target environment, or to the contents
of the environment. Philex builds on the facilities of the
linguex package.
