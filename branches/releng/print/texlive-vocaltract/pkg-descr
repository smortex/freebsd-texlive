The package enables the user to visualise the vocal tract. The
vocal tract (in the package) is manipulated by a vector of
articulation parameters according to the S. Maeda model.
Animation may be achieved by providing a sequence of vectors
over time (e.g., from Matlab). A sequence of vectors for
certain German phonemes is embedded in the package, which
allows for animation when no other vector is available. The
package's graphics are produced using pstricks.
