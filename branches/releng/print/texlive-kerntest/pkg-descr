This class makes it easy to generate tables that show many
different kerning pairs of an arbitrary font, usable by LaTeX.
It shows the kerning values that are used in the the font by
default. In addition, this class enables the user to alter the
kernings and to observe the results. Kerning pairs can be
defined for groups of similar glyphs at the same time. An mtx
file is generated automatically. The mtx file may then be
loaded by fontinst to introduce the user-made kernings into the
virtual font for later use in LaTeX.
