The package implements all the font testing commands of Knuth's
testfont.tex, but arranges that information necessary for each
command is supplied as arguments to that command, rather than
prompted for. This makes it possible to type all the tests in
one command line, and easy to input the package in a file and
to use the commands there. A few additional commands supporting
this last purpose are also made available.
