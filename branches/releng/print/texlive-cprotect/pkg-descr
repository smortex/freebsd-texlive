The package defines the macro \cprotect that makes a following
macro proof against verbatim in its argument; as, for example,
\cprotect\section{\verb"foo"} A similar macro \cprotEnv
(applied to the \begin of an environment) sanitises the
behavior of fragile environments. Moving arguments, and
corresponding tables of work happily.
