LaTeX's figures, tables, and \marginpars are dangerous for
footnotes (and probably also \enlargethispage). Here is a
proposal (a 'patch' package) to help, by using \holdinginserts
in a simple way. It replaces the original problem with a new
one -- it is an experiment to find out whether the new problem
is less bad (or it is just a contribution to the discussion,
maybe just a summary of previous work). The files provide
further information.
