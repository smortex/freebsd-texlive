The package offers a collection of simple macros for preparing
presentations in Plain TeX. Slide colour and text colour may be
set, links between parts of the presentation, to other files,
and to web addresses may be inserted. Images may be included
easily. The structure of the macros is not overly complex, so
that users should find it easy to adapt the macros to their
specific needs.
