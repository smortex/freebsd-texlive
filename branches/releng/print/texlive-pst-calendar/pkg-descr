The pst-calendar package uses pstricks and pst-3d to draw
tabular calendars, or calendars on dodecahedra with a month to
each face (the package also requires the multido and pst-xkey
packages). The package works for years 2000-2099, and has
options for calendars in French German and English, but the
documentation is not available in English.
