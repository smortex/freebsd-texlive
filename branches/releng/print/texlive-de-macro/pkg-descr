De-macro is a Python script that helps authors who like to use
private LaTeX macros (for example, as abbreviations). A
technical editor or a cooperating author may balk at such a
manuscript; you can avoid manuscript rejection misery by
running de-macro on it. De-macro will expand macros defined in
\(re)newcommand or \(re)newenvironment commands, within the
document, or in the document's "private" package file.
