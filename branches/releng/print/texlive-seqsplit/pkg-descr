When one needs to type long sequences of letters (such as in
base-sequences in genes) or of numbers (such as calculations of
transcendental numbers), there's no obvious break points to be
found. The package provides a command \seqsplit, which makes
its argument splittable anywhere, and then leaves the TeX
paragraph-maker to do the splitting. While the package may
obviously be used to typeset DNA sequences, the user may
consider the dnaseq as a rather more powerful alternative.
