The package provides a small number of convenient macros that
access features in other frequently-used packages. Most of
these macros use pgfkeys to provide a key-value syntax. The
package also uses the package scrlfile from the Koma-Script
bundle (for controlled loading of other files) and etoolbox.
The package provides sub-packages containing actual interfaces:
by default, the package loads all available interface sub-
packages, but techniques are provided for the user to select no
more than the interfaces needed for a job.
