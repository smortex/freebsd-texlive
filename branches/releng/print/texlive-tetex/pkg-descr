teTeX was a comprehensive distribution of TeX, LaTeX and
family, designed to for ease of compilation, installation and
customisation. In 2006, Thomas Esser announced he would no
longer be able to support, or to produce new versions of,
teTeX. With the appearance of TeX live 2007 (whose Unix-system
TeX support originally derived from teTeX), no-one should be
using teTeX at all, in new applications. One of the "schemes"
available when installing TeX live provides a configuration
very close to that of the old teTeX, but using modern versions
of programs and packages.
