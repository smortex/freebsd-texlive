The package provides macros that help to build a document
repository for long living documents. It focuses on structure
and re-use of text, code, figures etc. The basic concept is
first to separate structure from content (i.e., text about a
topic from the structure it is presented by) and then
separating the content from the actual published document, thus
enabling easy re-use of text blocks in different publications
(i.e., text about a protocol in a short article about this
protocol as well as in a book about many protocols); all
without constantly copying or changing text. As a side effect,
using the document classes provided, it hides a lot of LaTeX
from someone who just wants to write articles and books.
