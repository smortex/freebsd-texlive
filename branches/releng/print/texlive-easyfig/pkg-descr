The package provides the command \Figure[<key=value>...]{<image
filename>} to simplify the business of including an image as
figure in the most common form (centred and with caption and
label). Caption and label are set using the caption and label
keys. The label defaults to fig:<image filename> if not used.
The package uses the author's package adjustbox to centre an
image and to allow for easy further modifications.
