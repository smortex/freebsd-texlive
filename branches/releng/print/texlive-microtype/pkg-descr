The package provides a LaTeX interface to pdfTeX's micro-
typographic extensions: character protrusion and font
expansion. The package also offers a lua interface to the
corresponding features of LuaTeX. The package allows you to
restrict character protrusion and/or font expansion to a
certain set of fonts, or to certain parts of the document (for
example, based on selected language), and to configure micro-
typographic aspects of the fonts in a straight-forward and
flexible way. Settings for various fonts are provided. The
bundle also provides a letterspace package; this improves on
the alternatives (letterspacing and soul), and also provides a
means of protecting ligatures--notably those in fraktur fonts.
Note: Font expansion and character protrusion only work with
pdfTeX and LuaTeX. For pdfTeX, at least version 0.14f is
required; version 1.20a is needed for automatic font expansion.
With pdfTeX version 1.30, a command is provided for suppressing
ligatures.
