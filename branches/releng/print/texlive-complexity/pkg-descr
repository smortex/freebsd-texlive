Complexity is a LaTeX package that defines commands to typeset
Computational Complexity Classes such as $\P$ and $\NP$ (as
well as hundreds of others). It also offers several options
including which font classes are typeset in and how many are
defined (all of them or just the basic, most commonly used
ones). The package has no dependencies other than the standard
ifthen package.
