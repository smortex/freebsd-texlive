The package defines a convenient interface to put any LaTeX
material on top of included graphics. The LaTeX material may
also be rotated and typeset on top of a white box overshadowing
the graphics. The coordinates of the LaTeX boxes are given
relative to the original, unscaled graphics; when the graphics
is rescaled, the LaTeX annotations stay at their right places
(unless you do something extreme). In a draft mode, the package
enables you to draw a coordinate grid over the picture for easy
adjustment of positions of the annotations.
