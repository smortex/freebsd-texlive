The package provides a friendly interface for defining the
meaning of Unicode characters. The document should be processed
by (pdf)LaTeX with \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} or by
XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX. The command provided is
\newunicodechar{<char>}{<code>} where <char> is a directly-
typed Unicode character, and <code> is its replacement.
