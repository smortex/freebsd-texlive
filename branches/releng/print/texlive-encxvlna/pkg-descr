The package provides tools for inserting nonbreakable spaces
after nonsyllabic prepositions and single letter conjunctions
as required by Czech and Slovak typographical rules. It is
implemented using encTeX and provides files both for plain TeX
and LaTeX. The LaTeX solution tries to avoid conflicts with
other packages.
