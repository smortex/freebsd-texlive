The package will directly insert nonbreakable spaces (in Czech,
vlna or vlnka), after nonsyllabic prepositions and single
letter conjuctions, while the document is being typeset. (The
macros recognised maths and verbatim by TeX means.) (Inserting
nonbreakable spaces by a preprocessor will probably never be
fully reliable, because user defined macros and environments
cannot reliably be recognised.) The package works both with
(Plain) XeTeX and with XeLaTeX.
