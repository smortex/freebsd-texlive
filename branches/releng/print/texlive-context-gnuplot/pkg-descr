Enables simple creation and inclusion of graphs with Gnuplot.
The package writes a script into temporary file, runs Gnuplot
and includes the resulting graphic directly into the document.
You probably also want to have the Gnuplot extension for the
package (though it's not yet part of official Gnuplot).
