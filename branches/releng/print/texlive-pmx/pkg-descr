PMX is a preprocessor for MusiXTeX. It builds the TeX input
file from a file in a much simpler language, making most of the
layout decisions by itself. An auxiliary program makes single-
player parts from a multi-player score. For proof-listening,
PMX can make a MIDI file of your score. The present version
requires at least version 1.15 of MusiXTeX, running on an e-
tex-enhanced TeX system.
