Macros to Change Text and Math fonts in TeX: 19 Beautiful
Variants These macros are written for plain TeX and can be used
with other packages like AmSTeX, eplain, etc. They allow you to
change the fonts (text and math) in your TeX document with only
one statement. Also different font sizes are available. All the
fonts called by these macro files are free and are included in
the present MiKTeX and TeX Live distributions.
