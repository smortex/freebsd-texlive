MHequ simplifies creating multi-column equation environments,
and tagging the equations therein. It supports sub-numbers of
blocks of equations (like (1.2a), (1.2b), etc) and references
to each equation individually (1.2a) or to the whole block
(1.2). The labels can be shown in draft mode. Comments in the
package itself describe usage.
