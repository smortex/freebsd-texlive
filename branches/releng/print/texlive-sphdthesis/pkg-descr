The package provides a LaTeX document class for writing a PhD
thesis. The author developed it while writing his PhD thesis in
School of Computing (SoC), National University of Singapore
(NUS). By default, it adheres to the NUS Guidelines on Format
of Research Thesis Submitted For Examination (Link updated on
31/05/2014). However, it is quite easy to change it to a
different guideline.
