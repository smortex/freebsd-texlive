E-TeX provides 32 768 mark registers; using this facility is
far more comfortable than LaTeX tricks with \markright,
\markboth, \leftmark and \rightmark. The package provides two
commands for marking: \marksthe and \marksthecs, which have *
forms which disable expansion; new mark registers are allocated
as needed. Syntax is closely modelled on the \marks primitive.
Four commands are provided for retrieving the marks registers'
content: \thefirstmarks, \thebotmarks, thetopmarks and
\getthemarks; and the command \ifmarksequal is available for
comparing the content of marks registers. The package requires
an e-TeX-enabled engine, and the etex package.
