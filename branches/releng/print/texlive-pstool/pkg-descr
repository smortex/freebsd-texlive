The package works in the same sort of way as pst-pdf,
processing PostScript graphics with psfrag labels within
documents running with pdfLaTeX. Pstool ensures that each
version of each graphic is compiled once only (the graphic is
(re-)compiled only if it has changed since the previous
compilation of the document). This drastically speeds up the
running of the package in the typical case (though the first
run of any document is inevitably just as slow as with any
similar package).
