The bundledoc package is a post-processor for the snapshot
package that bundles together all the classes, packages and
files needed to build a given LaTeX document. It reads the .dep
file that snapshot produces, finds each of the files mentioned
therein, and archives them into a single .tar.gz (or .zip, or
whatever) file, suitable for moving across systems,
transmitting to a colleague, etc. A script, arlatex, provides
an alternative "archiving" mechanism, creating a single LaTeX
file that contains all of the ancillary files of a LaTeX
document, together with the document itself, using the
filecontents* environment.
