The package ltxnew provides the \new, \renew and \provide
prefixes for checking definitions. It is designed to work with
e-TeX distributions of LaTeX and relies on the LaTeX macro
\@ifdefinable. Local allocation of counters, dimensions, skips,
muskips, boxes, tokens and marks are provided by the etex
package. \new and \renew as well as \provide may be used for
all kind of control sequences. Please refer to the section
"Using \new" of the PDF documentation.
