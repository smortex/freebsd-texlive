This package extends the usability of the ocgx package by Paul
Gaborit for creating PDF Layers to all known engines including:
LaTeX -> dvips -> ps2pdf/Distiller (Xe)LaTeX(x) -> dvipdfmx
(PdfLaTeX and LuaLaTeX are already supported by ocgx.) It also
ensures compatibility with the media9 and animate packages.
