The package allows the user to insert comments into a document
that suggest (for example) further editing that may be needed.
The comments are shown in the margins alongside the text;
different styles for the comments may be used; the styles are
selected using package options. The package is based on the
package todonotes, and depends heavily on Lua, so it can only
be used with LuaLaTeX.
