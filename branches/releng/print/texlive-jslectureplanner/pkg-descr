The jslectureplanner package facilitates the generation and
management of university course material. It provides an
interface to set up and access centralized course data that can
be reused in all course documents. Furthermore, the package is
able to calculate the session dates of a whole semester and
generate course programs, if the course is held weekly and the
date of the first lecture is specified. Moreover, the package
can be used to generate a sectioned course bibliography via
biblatex.
