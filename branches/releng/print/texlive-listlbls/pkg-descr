This is a package meant to help a LaTeX-writer to keep track of
all defined labels by typesetting a complete list of labels
wherever the author requests it. Keep in mind, that you might
need to have additional LaTeX runs to get the references right.
This package is based on an answer David Carlisle gave on TEX-
Stackexchange in the thread [List of all labels with
hyperlinks.
