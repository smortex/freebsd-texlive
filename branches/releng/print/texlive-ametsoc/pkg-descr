This package contains all the files necessary to write an
article using latex for the American Meteorological Society
journals. The article and bibliography style files are provided
along with two PDFs describing the use of the files and a blank
template for authors to use in writing their article. Also
available is a separate style file used to format a two-column,
journal page layout draft for the author's personal use.
