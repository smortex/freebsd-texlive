Dvisvgm is a command line utility that converts TeX DVI files
to the XML-based Scalable Vector Graphics format. The current
version provides basic conversion functionality; development of
an improved version continues. Users will need a working TeX
installation including the kpathsea library and Type 1 versions
of the fonts used in the DVI file. Dvisvgm has been
successfully tested with both teTeX and MikTeX.
