The package defines a new environment that, unlike tabularX,
typesets a table of specified width by working on the inter-
column glue; the tabular cells will all be stretched (or
shrunk) according to need. The package will use the e-TeX
arithmetic extensions if they are available (they are, in most
modern distributions).
