The package provides the means of establishing a consistent set
of fonts for use in a LaTeX document. It allows mixing and
matching the Type 1 font sets available on the archive (and it
may be extended, via its configuration file, to support other
fonts). Font-set definition takes the form of a set of options
that are read when the package is loaded: for each typographic
category (main body font, sans-serif font, monospace font,
mathematics fonts, text figures, and so on), a font or a
transformation is given in those options. The approach enables
the user to remember their own configurations (as a single
command) and to borrow configurations that other users have
developed. The present release is designated "for review".
