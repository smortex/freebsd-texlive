The 'sprite' format the package sets is very simple, and may be
viewed in a fixed-width font rather readily. The package
provides the means of typesetting these sprites at arbitrary
sizes; in principal, one might use them to substitute for
characters one needed, but the author notes that their use is
rather TeX-memory-intensive so that their use as a font
substitute is hardly likely to be tenable.
