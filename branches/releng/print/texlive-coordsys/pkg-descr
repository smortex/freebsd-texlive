The package provides commands for typesetting number lines
(coordinate axes), coordinate systems and grids in the picture
environment. The package may be integrated with other drawing
mechanisms: the documentation shows examples of drawing graphs
(coordinate tables created by Maple), using the eepic package's
drawing capabilities.
