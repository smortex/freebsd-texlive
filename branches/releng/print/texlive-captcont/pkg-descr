The captcont package provides the ability to continue the
numbering in your float environment (figure, table, etc.) with
minimal overhead. This package adds three commands: \caption*,
\captcont, and \captcont*. Along with the \caption command,
these give full control over the caption numbering, caption
text and the entries in the list-of pages. The \caption and
\captcont commands generate list-of page entries. The \caption
and \caption* commands increment the figure or table counter.
Captcont also fully supports the subfigure package.
