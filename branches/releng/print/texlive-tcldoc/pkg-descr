The tclldoc package and class simplify the application of the
doc/docstrip style of literate programming with Dr. John
Ousterhout's Tool Command Language (Tcl, pronounced "tickle",
a.k.a. The Cool Language). The tclldoc package is a bit like
the doc package is for LaTeX, whereas the tclldoc class more
parallels the ltxdoc class.
