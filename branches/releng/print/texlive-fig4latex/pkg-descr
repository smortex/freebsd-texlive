Fig4LaTeX simplifies management of the figures in a large LaTeX
document. Fig4LaTeX is appropriate for projects that include
figures with graphics created by XFig -- in particular,
graphics which use the combined PS/LaTeX (or PDF/LaTeX) export
method. An example document (with its output) is provided.
