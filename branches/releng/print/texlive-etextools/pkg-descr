The package offers four categories of macros: - the \expandnext
macro and other expansion control macros; - the \FE@testopt and
\FE@ifstar macros for fully expandable (FE) (starred-)macros
with option; - fully expandable command list parsers: \csvloop,
\listloop and a general constructor; - three macros lacking
from the etoolbox package: \listdel, \listgdel and \listxdel.
The package is dependent on the etex and the etoolbox packages.
