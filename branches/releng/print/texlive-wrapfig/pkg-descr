Allows figures or tables to have text wrapped around them. Does
not work in combination with list environments, but can be used
in a parbox or minipage, and in twocolumn format. Supports the
float package. Note that most of the package documentation is
contained in the package file itself (after the \endinput
command at the end of the package proper).
