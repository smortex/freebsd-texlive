This package allows you to use alphanumeric section numbering,
for instance "A. Introduction ... III. International Law". Its
output is similar to alphanum, but you can use the standard
LaTeX sectioning commands, so that it is possible to switch
numbering schemes easily. Greek letters, double letters (bb)
and different delimiters around them are supported.
