As an alternative to the LaTeX standard environments quotation
and quote, the quoting package provides a consolidated
environment for displayed text. First-line indentation is
activated by adding a blank line before the quoting
environment. A key--value interface allows to configure font
properties and spacing and to control orphans within and after
the environment.
