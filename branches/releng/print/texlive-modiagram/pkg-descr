The package provides an environment MOdiagram and some
commands, to create molecular orbital diagrams using the TikZ
package. For example, the MO diagram of dihydrogen would be set
like: \begin{MOdiagram} \atom{left}{ 1s = {0;up} }
\atom{right}{ 1s = {0;up} } \molecule{ 1sMO = {1;pair, } }
\end{MOdiagram} The package also needs the l3kernel l3packages
bundles from the LaTeX 3 distribution.
