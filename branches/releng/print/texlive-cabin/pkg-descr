Cabin is a humanist sans with four weights and true italics and
small capitals. According to the designer, Pablo Impallari,
Cabin was inspired by Edward Johnston's and Eric Gill's
typefaces, with a touch of modernism. Cabin incorporates modern
proportions, optical adjustments, and some elements of the
geometric sans. cabin.sty supports LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, xeLaTeX and
luaLaTeX.
