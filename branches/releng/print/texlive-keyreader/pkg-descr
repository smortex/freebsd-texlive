The package provides a robust interface to controlling keys in
xkeyval, removing some of that package's restrictions and
adding the concept of complementary boolean keys. The package
addresses some of the issues now covered by the author's
ltxkeys package, which was assumed to be a replacement for
keyreader. Since the package has remained a favourite with
users, it has been reinstated.
