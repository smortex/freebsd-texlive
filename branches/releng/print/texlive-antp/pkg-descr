A replica of Antykwa Poltawskiego font in PostScript Type 1
format -- preliminary version. This font was designed in the
'twenties and the 'thirties of XX century by a Polish graphic
artist and a typographer Adam Poltawski. It was widely used by
Polish printing houses as long as metal types were in use
(until ca. the 'sixties). Antykwa Poltawskiego was perhaps the
first complete font family programmed and parametrized in
MetaPost.
