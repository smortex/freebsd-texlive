A slide format which produces slides with a simple Power Point
like appearance. Several useful features include: use of
standard titlepage to produce title slide; several slide
environments including plain (page with a title), double slide
(two column page with slide title), item slide (item list with
title), left item slide, and right item slide. Logos are placed
in the upper left corner of each slide if the logo file
logo.eps is present. Preconfigured in landscape mode by default
and uses Times Roman by default (originally, it was claimed,
for simple conversion to PDF format).
