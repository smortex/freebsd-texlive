M-Tx is a preprocessor to pmx, which is itself a preprocessor
to musixtex, a music typesetting system. The prime motivation
to the development of M-Tx was to provide lyrics for music to
be typeset. In fact, pmx now provides a lyrics interface, but
M-Tx continues in use by those who prefer its language.
