Aids in the task of checking whether a command defined in a
document preamble is actually used somewhere in the document.
If you use the package cmdtrack to the preamble of your
document, all \newcommand and similar statements between that
point and the beginning of the document will be marked for
logging. At the end of the document a report of the command
usage will be printed in the TeX log, for example: mdash was
used on line 25; ndash was never used.
