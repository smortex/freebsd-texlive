The translator package provides an open platform for packages
that need to be localized. Unlike the babel package (which can
and typically will be used together with translator), the set
of words that can be translated is not fixed and new words and
translations can be added in a simple manner. New translations
can be added in a decentralized manner. The package is written
completely in LaTeX and it is quite lightweight. It could very
easily be ported to plain-TeX or ConTeXt, provided there is a
'public demand' for it. A typical application of this package
is the beamer class, which already uses it, if it present. Then
words like "Theorem" will be translated to "Satz" if the
document language is German, for instance.
