Sparklines are intense, simple, wordlike graphics (so named by
Edward Tufte). In lieu of a more detailed introduction,
Professor Tufte's site has an early release of a chapter on
sparklines. A PHP implementation may be found at SourceForge. A
sparkline can be added using the sparkline environment. Also,
you can add sparkling rectangles for the median and special
sparkling dots in red or blue. The package requires pdflatex;
sparklines cannot appear in a dvi file. The sparklines package
uses pgf, and does not work with pictex.
