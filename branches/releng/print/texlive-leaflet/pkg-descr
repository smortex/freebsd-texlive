A document class to create small hand-outs (flyers) that fit on
a single sheet of paper which is then folded twice. Pages are
rearranged by LaTeX so that they print correctly on a single
sheet -- no external script is necessary. (Works with
PostScript and PDF.) This is a complete reimplementation with
permission of the original author Jurgen Schlegelmilch.
