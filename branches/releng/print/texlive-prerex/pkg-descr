This package consists of prerex.sty, a LaTeX package for
producing charts of course nodes linked by arrows representing
pre- and co-requisites, and prerex, an interactive program for
creating and editing chart descriptions. The implementation of
prerex.sty is built on PGF, so that it may be used equally
happily with latex or pdflatex; prerex itself is written in C.
The package includes source code for a previewer application, a
lightweight Qt-4 and poppler-based prerex-enabled PDF viewer.
