The package provides the means to insert OGC (Optional Group
Content, known as layers) into PDF presentations. This allows
the user to insert any TeX material into separate layers in a
PDF document and also insert links which toggle these layers on
and off. Parts of the PDF document, such as formatted text,
tables, maths formulas or graphics may be switched to visible
or invisible state by clicking active links or buttons. The
documentation discusses the package's relation to various
apparently similar packages.
