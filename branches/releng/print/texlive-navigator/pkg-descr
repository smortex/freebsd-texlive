Navigator implements PDF features for all formats (with some
limitations in ConTeXt) with PDFTeX, LuaTeX and XeTeX (i.e.
xdvipdfmx). Features include: - Customizable outlines (i.e.
bookmarks); - Anchors; - Links and actions (e.g. JavaScript or
user-defined PDF actions); - File embedding (not in ConTeXt); -
Document information and PDF viewer's display (not in ConTeXt);
and - Commands to create and use raw PDF objects. Navigator
requires texapi and yax, both version at least 1.03.
