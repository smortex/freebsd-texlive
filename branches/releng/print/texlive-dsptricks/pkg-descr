The package DSPTricks is a set of LaTeX macros (based on
PSTricks) for plotting the kind of graphs and figures that are
usually employed in digital signal processing publications.
DSPTricks provides facilities for standard discrete-time
"lollipop" plots, continuous-time and frequency plots, and pole-
zero plots. The companion package DSPFunctions
(dspfunctions.sty) provides macros for computing frequency
responses and DFTs, while the package DSPBlocks (dspblocks.sty)
supports DSP block diagrams.
