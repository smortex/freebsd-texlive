MiKTeX and many other TeX implementations include tools for
massaging PostScript into booklet and two-up printing -- that
is, printing two logical pages side by side on one side of one
sheet of paper. However, some LaTeX preliminaries are necessary
to use those tools. The twoup package provides such
preliminaries and gives advice on how to use the PostScript
tools.
