The bundle provides a beamer-derived class and a theme style
file for the corporate design of the Free University in Berlin.
Users may use the class itself (FUbeamer) or use the theme in
the usual way with \usetheme{BerlinFU}. Examples of using both
the class and the theme are provided; the PDF is visually
identical, so the catalogue only lists one; the sources of the
examples do of course differ.
