XyMTeX is a set of packages for drawing a wide variety of
chemical structural formulas in a way that reflects their
structure. The package provides three output modes: 'LaTeX',
'PostScript' and 'PDF'. XyMTeX's commands have a systematic set
of arguments for specifying substituents and their positions,
endocyclic double bonds, and bond patterns. In some cases there
are additional arguments for specifying hetero-atoms on the
vertices of heterocycles. It is believed that this systematic
design allows XyMTeX to operate as a practical (device-
independent) tool for use with LaTeX.
