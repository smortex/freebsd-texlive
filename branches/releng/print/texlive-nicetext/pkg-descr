Nicetext bundle offers "minimal" markup syntax for various
simple kinds of text. The code you type should involve little
more than is printed, and you still get LaTeX quality. The
bundle provides four packages: - wiki addresses general texts,
marked up in the simple style used on Wikipedia; - niceverb is
yet another means of documenting LaTeX packages: it offers
syntax-aware typesetting of meta-variables (macro arguments)
and for referring to commands (and their syntax) in footnotes,
section titles etc.; - fifinddo aims to parse plain text or
(La)TeX files using TeX, and to write the results to an
external file. This generalises the philosophy behind docstrip:
the package aims at practical application, and is used by -
makedoc, which provides the means to typeset package files.
