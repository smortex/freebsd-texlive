Sans-serif Greek fonts to match the URW Bookman set (which are
distributed with Kerkis). The Kerkis font set has some support
for mathematics as well as other glyphs missing from the base
URW Bookman fonts (the URW fonts are duplicated in the
distribution). Macros are provided to use the fonts in OT1, T1
(only NG/ng glyphs missing) and LGR encodings, as well as in
mathematics; small caps and old-style number glyphs are also
available. The philosophy, and the design process, of the
Kerkis fonts is discussed in a paper in TUGboat 23(3/4), 2002.
