The mh bundle is a series of packages designed to enhance the
appearance of documents containing a lot of math. The main
backbone is amsmath, so those unfamiliar with this required
part of the LaTeX system will probably not find the packages
very useful. Component parts of the bundle are: empheq,
flexisym, mathtools, mhsetup, breqn, mathstyle and xfrac. The
empheq package is a visual markup extension of amsmath. Empheq
allows sophisticated boxing and other marking of multi-line
maths displays, and fixes problems with ntheorem package place
end-of-theorem markers. The mathtools package provides many
useful tools for mathematical typesetting. It fixes various
deficiencies of amsmath and standard LaTeX. The mhsetup package
defines various programming tools needed by both empheq and
mathtools. The breqn package makes more easy the business of
preparing displayed equations in LaTeX, including permitting
automatic line-breaking within displayed equations. (Breqn uses
the mathstyle package to keep track of the current maths
typesetting style, something that raw TeX hides from the
programmer.)
