The package supports those who publish articles in peer-
reviewed journals. In the final stages of the review process,
the authors typically have to provide an additional document
(such as a letter to the editors), in which they provide a list
of modifications that they made to the manuscript. The package
automatically provides line numbers and quotations from the
manuscript, for this letter. The package loads the package
lineno, so (in effect) shares lineno's incompatibilities.
