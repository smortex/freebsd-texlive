An extended grid-based puzzle package, designed to take all
input (both grid and clues) from the same file. The package can
typeset grids with holes in them (for advertisements, or other
sorts of stuff), and can deal with several sorts of puzzle: -
The classical puzzle contains numbers for the words and clues
for the words to be filled in. - The numbered puzzle contains
numbers in each cell where identical numbers represent
identical letters. The goal is to find out which number
corresponds to which letter. - The fill-in type of puzzle
consists of a grid and a list of words. The goal is to place
all words in the grid. - Sudoku and Kakuro puzzles involve
filling in grids of numbers according to their own rules.
Format may be block-separated, or separated by thick lines.
Input to the package is somewhat redundant: specification of
the grid is separate from specification of the clues (if
they're necessary). The author considers this style both
'natural' and robust.
