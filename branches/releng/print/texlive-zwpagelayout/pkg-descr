This package was developed as a typographers' toolbox offering
the most important features for everyday work. First it allows
setting the paper size as well as the page layout. The next
important feature is the ability to print crop marks both with
TeX + dvips or (x)dvipdfm(x) and with pdfTeX. Finally it is
possible to reflect pages both horizontally and vertically.
