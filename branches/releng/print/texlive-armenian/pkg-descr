ArmTeX is an Armenian system for TeX/LaTeX(2e)/MetaFont. It can
be used with a standard Latin keyboard without any special
encoding and/or support for Armenian letters. It can also be
used with any keyboard which uses encoding having Armenian
letters in the second half (characters 128-255) of the extended
ASCII table (for example ArmSCII8 Armenian standard).
