Itrans is a pre-processor: it converts English-encoded text
into various Indian Language scripts for printing or for
display. The input text to itrans is in a transliterated form:
each letter in an Indian Script is assigned an English
equivalent, and the English letters are used to represent what
will eventually print out in the Indian Language Script.
