Pkfix is a useful utility for replacing resolution-dependent
bitmapped fonts in a dvips-produced PostScript file with the
corresponding resolution-independent vector fonts.
Unfortunately, pkfix needs to parse certain PostScript comments
that appear only in files produced by dvips versions later than
5.58 (ca. 1996); it fails to work on PostScript files produced
by older versions of dvips. Pkfix-helper is a program that
attempts to insert newer-dvips comments into an older-dvips
PostScript file, thereby making the file suitable for
processing by pkfix. pkfix-helper can sometimes process
documents fully autonomously but does require the user to
verify and, if needed, correct its decisions.
