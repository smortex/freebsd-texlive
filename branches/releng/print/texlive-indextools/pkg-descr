This package is a fork of the imakeidx package. The original
authors of imakeidx declined some upgrade suggestions to remove
incompatibilities with certain packages that are particularly
important with critical editions dealing with languages that
are being written from right to left. Therefore this fork was
created in order to let other users benefit from its
functionalities very useful in the field of humanities.
