The package provides macros for typesetting basic arithmetic,
in the style typically found in textbooks. It focuses on the
American style of performing these algorithms. It is written
mostly in low-level TeX, with the goal that it should run in
either plain TeX or LaTeX, but there are two constructions that
currently prevent this. It is highly configurable, with macros
and lengths described in the documentation.
