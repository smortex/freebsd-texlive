This package provides the command \thepagecolor, which gives
the current page (background) colour, i. e. the argument used
with the most recent call of \pagecolor{...}. The command
\thepagecolornone gives the same colour as \thepagecolor,
except when the page background colour is "none" (e.g., as a
result of using the \nopagecolor command). In that case
\thepagecolor is "white" and \thepagecolornone is "none".
