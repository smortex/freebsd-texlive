The package provides citations according with the house style
of the 'Historische Zeitschrift', a German historical journal.
The scheme is a fullcite for the first citation and 'Author,
Shorttitle (as note N, P)' for later citations (P being the
page number). For further details, see the description of the
house style at the journal's site. The package depends on
biblatex (version 0.8 or higher) as well as etoolbox (version
1.5 or higher).
