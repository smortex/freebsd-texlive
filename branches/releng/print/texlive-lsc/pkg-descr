This package is similar to the msc package in that it provides
macros for typesetting a variant of sequence diagrams, in this
case the Live Sequence Charts of Damm and Harel. The package
supports the full LSC language of the original LSC paper, the
Klose-extensions for formal verification and some of the Harel-
extensions for the Play-In/Play-Out approach (cf. the manual).
