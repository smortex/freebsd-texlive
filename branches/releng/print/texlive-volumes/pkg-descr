This package helps you if you want to produce separate printed
volumes from one LaTeX document, as well as one comprehensive,
"all-inclusive" version. It suppresses the part of the table of
contents that are not typeset, while counters, definitions,
index entries etc. are kept consistent throughout the input
file.
