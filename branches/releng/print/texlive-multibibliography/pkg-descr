Conventional standards for bibliography styles impose a forced
choice between index and name/year citations, and corresponding
references. The package avoids this choice, by providing
alphabetic, sequenced, and even chronological orderings of
references. Inline citations, that integrate these
heterogeneous styles, are also supported (and work with other
bibliography packages).
