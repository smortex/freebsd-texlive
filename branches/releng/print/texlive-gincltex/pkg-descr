The package builds on the standard LaTeX packages graphics
and/or graphicx and allows external LaTeX source files to be
included, in the same way as graphic files, by
\includegraphics. In effect, then package adds support for the
.tex extension. Some of the lower level operations like
clipping and trimming are implemented using the pgf package
which supports both DVI/PS and PDF output. The package uses a
very similar technique to that of the author's other package
adjustbox, but provides a different interface.
