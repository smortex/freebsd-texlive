The dot2texi package allows you to embed graphs in the DOT
graph description language in your LaTeX documents. The dot2tex
tool is used to invoke Graphviz for graph layout, and to
transform the output from Graphviz to LaTeX code. The generated
code relies on the TikZ and PGF package or the PSTricks
package. The process is automated if shell escape is enabled.
