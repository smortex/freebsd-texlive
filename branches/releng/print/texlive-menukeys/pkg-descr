The package allows easy input and formatting of menu sequences,
using menus set with commands such as \menu{Extras > Settings >
General}, paths using a command like
\path{macros/latex/contrib/menukeys} and short cuts such aas
\keys{\ctrl + C}. The output is highly configurable by
providing different styles and colour themes.
