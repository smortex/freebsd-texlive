The package provides pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX support for
the Carlito family of sans serif fonts, designed by Lukasz
Dziedzic of the tyPoland foundry and adopted by Google for
ChromeOS as a font-metric compatible replacement for Calibri.
Note that the traditional LaTeX engine is not supported.
