The current release of this package typesets mathematics with
unicode input and using OpenType maths fonts. (There is little
compatibility with older maths packages.) XeTeX support is well
tested, though LuaTeX support less so. The package can typeset
using STIX fonts, the XITS development of those fonts, the
Asana-Math fonts and the commercial Cambria Math fonts. There
is no support yet for any extra alphabets in the Unicode
'private use area'. The package relies on recent versions of
the fontspec package and the expl3 and xpackages bundles.
