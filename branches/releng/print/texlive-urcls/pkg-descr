The bundle provides a beamer-derived class and a theme style
file for the corporate design of the University of Regensburg.
It also contains a scrlttr2-derived class for letters using the
corporate design of the UR. Users may use the class itself
(URbeamer) or use the theme in the usual way with
\usetheme{UR}. Examples of using both letters and presentations
are provided as .tex and .pdf-files.
