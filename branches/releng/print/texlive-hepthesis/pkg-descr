Hepthesis is a LaTeX class for typesetting large academic
reports, in particular PhD theses. It was originally developed
for typesetting the author's high-energy physics PhD thesis and
includes some features specifically tailored to such an
application. In particular, hepthesis offers: - Attractive
semantic environments for various rubric sections; - Extensive
options for draft production, screen viewing and binding-ready
output; - Helpful extensions of existing environments,
including equation and tabular; and - Support for quotations at
the start of the thesis and each chapter. The class is based on
scrbook, from the KOMA-Script bundle.
