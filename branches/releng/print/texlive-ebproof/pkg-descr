This package provides commands to typeset proof trees in the
style of sequent calculus and related systems. The commands
allow for writing inferences with any number of premisses and
alignment of successive formulas on an arbitrary point. Various
options allow complete control over spacing, styles of
inference rules, placement of labels, etc. The package requires
pgfkeys (from the PGF/TikZ bundle) for the option system.
