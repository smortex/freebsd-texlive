More and more banks allow their customers to download posting
records in various formats. By using the bankstatement class,
you can create bank statements, as long as a csv format is
available. At the moment, the csv-mt940 and csv-camt formats --
used by many german Sparkassen -- are supported. You can quite
easily add support for other csv formats. Simply define the
order of the keys in the csv data file and how to use them. The
terminology in this class like BIC (Business Identifier Code)
or IBAN (International Bank Account Number) is based on SEPA
(Single Euro Payments Area). But you can adjust the terminology
to suit your needs.
