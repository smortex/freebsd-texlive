VPE is a system to make the equivalent of "source special"
marks in a PDF file. Clicking on a mark will activate an
editor, pointing at the source line that produced the text that
was marked. The system comprises a perl file (vpe.pl) and a
LaTeX package (vpe.sty); it will work with PDF files generated
via LaTeX/dvips, pdfTeX (version 0.14 or better), and
LaTeX/VTeX. Using the LaTeX/dvips or pdfLaTeX routes, the
(pdf)TeX processor shoud be run with shell escapes enabled.
