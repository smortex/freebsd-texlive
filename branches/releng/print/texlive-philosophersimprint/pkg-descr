In its mission statement we read "Philosophers' Imprint is a
refereed series of original papers in philosophy, edited by
philosophy faculty at the University of Michigan, with the
advice of an international Board of Editors, and published on
the World Wide Web by the University of Michigan Digital
Library. The mission of the Imprint is to promote a future in
which funds currently spent on journal subscriptions are
redirected to the dissemination of scholarship for free, via
the Internet". The journal used to accept manuscripts in Rich
Text Format only. However, for many authors, especially from
the field of logic, TeX seems to be a better choice. The author
was commissioned to write a LaTeX class for the journal. The
class helps authors to typeset their own articles in 'Web-
ready' format. No assumption is made about the fonts available
to the author: the class uses freely available and freely
distributed fonts, only.
