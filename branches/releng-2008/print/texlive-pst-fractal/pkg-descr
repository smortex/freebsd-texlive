The package will draw the Julia and Mandelbrot sets, the
Sierpinski triangle, Koch flake, and Apollonius Circle as well
as fractal trees (which need not be balanced) with a variety of
different parameters (including varying numbers of iterations).
The package uses the pst-xkey package, part of the xkeyval
distribution.
