This small package allows a LaTeX document containing the
citation commands provided by the Harvard package to be
compiled using the natbib package. Migration from harvard to
natbib thus can be achieved simply by replacing
\usepackage{harvard} with \usepackage{natbib}
\usepackage{har2nat} It is important that har2nat be loaded
after natbib, since it modifies natbib commands.
