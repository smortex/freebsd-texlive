The package provides commands to draw spectral sequence
diagrams, providing facilities for clipping and arranging
multiple symbols so that they do not overlap. The package is
usually based on XYpic, but may run using specialised font
structures with a large enough TeX and given enough time. Its
geometric commands are based on a turtle graphics model, and
control structures such as loops and conditionals are
available.
