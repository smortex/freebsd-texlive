Gnuplot code is extracted from the document and written to
.gnuplot files. Then, if shell escape is enabled, the graph
files are automatically processed and converted to PostScript
or PDF files, which will then be included. If shell escape is
disabled, the user will have to manually run the files through
gnuplot and re-run the LaTeX job.
