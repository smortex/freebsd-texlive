This package defines macros which are useful for many
documents. It is a large collection of simple ‘little
helpers’ which do not really warrant a separate package on
their own. Included are, among other things, definitions of
common units with preceeding thinspaces, framed boxes where
both width and height can be specified, starting new odd or
even pages, draft markers, notes, conditional includes,
including EPS files, and versions of enumerate and itemize
which allow the horizontal and vertical spacing to be changed.
