A collection of fragments of LaTeX code, suitable for inclusion
in packages, or (possibly) in users' documents. Included are:
– checklab, for modifying the label checking code at
\end{document}; – overrightarrow, defining a doubled over-
arrow macro; – removefr, for removing ‘reset’ relations
between counters; and – subscript, defining a \textsubscript
command.
