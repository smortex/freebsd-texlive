The Société mathématique de France provides a set of
classes, packages and bibtex styles that are used in its
publications. They are based on AMS classes (whose code is
sometimes recopied) and mainly ‘upward-compatible’. Their
main features are: quite different design; new environments for
typesetting some information in two languages (altabstract,
alttitle, altkeywords); if necessary, use of babel (option
frenchb) and deactivation of some features of frenchb. Includes
smfart.cls, smfbook.cls, smfplain.bst, smfalpha.bst, amongst
others.
