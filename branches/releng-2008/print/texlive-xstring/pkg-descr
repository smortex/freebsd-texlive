The package provides macros for manipulating strings —
testing a string’s contents, extracting substrings,
substitution of substrings and providing numbers such as string
length, position of, or number of recurrences of, a substring.
The package works equally in Plain TeX and LaTeX (though e-TeX
is always required), and the strings to be processed may
contain (expandable) macros.
