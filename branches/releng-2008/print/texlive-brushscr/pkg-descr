The BrushScript font is distributed in Adobe Type-1 format,
that simulates hand-written characters. The font is available
in italic shape only. The package includes the files needed by
LaTeX in order to use that font. The file AAA_readme.tex fully
describes the package and sample.tex illustrates its use.
