The package is intended for users needing to typeset a Dynkin
Tree Diagramâ€”a group theoretical construct consisting of
cartan coefficients in boxes connected by a series of lines.
Such a diagram is a tool for working out the states and their
weights in terms of the fundamental weights and the simple
roots. The package makes use of the author's coollist package.
