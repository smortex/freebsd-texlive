This bundle comprises two packages: – The linguex package
facilitates the formatting of linguist examples, automatically
taking care of example numbering, indentations, indexed
brackets, and the ‘*’ in grammaticality judgments. – The
ps-trees package provides linguistic trees, building on the
macros of tree-dvips, but overcoming some of the older
package’s shortcomings.
