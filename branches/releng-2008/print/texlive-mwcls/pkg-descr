mwcls is a set of document classes for LaTeX 2e designed with
Polish typographical tradition in mind. Classes include:
'mwart' (which is a replacement for 'article'), 'mwrep'
('report'), and 'mwbk' ('book'). Most features present in
standard classes work with mwcls. Some extensions/exceptions
include: sectioning commands allow for second optional argument
(it's possible to state different texts for running head and
for TOC), new environments 'itemize*' and 'enumerate*' for
lists with long items, page styles have variants for normal,
opening, closing, and blank pages.
