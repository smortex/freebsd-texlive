LaTeX can, by default, only cope with 18 outstanding floats;
any more, and you get the error “too many unprocessed
floats”. This package increases that limit to 36 outstanding
floats. However, if you're specifying floats that can’t be
placed anywhere, the package merely delays the arrival of the
error message.
