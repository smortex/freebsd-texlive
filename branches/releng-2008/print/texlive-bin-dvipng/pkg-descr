This program makes PNG and/or GIF graphics from DVI files as
obtained from TeX and its relatives. Its benefits include: –
Speed. It offers very fast rendering of DVI as bitmap files,
which makes it suitable for generating large amounts of images
on-the-fly, as needed in preview-latex, WeBWorK and others; –
It does not read the postamble, so it can be started before TeX
finishes. There is a --follow switch that makes dvipng wait at
end-of-file for further output, unless it finds the POST marker
that indicates the end of the DVI; – Interactive query of
options. dvipng can read options interactively through stdin,
and all options are usable. It is even possible to change the
input file through this interface. – Support for PK, VF,
PostScript Type1, and TrueType fonts, colour specials, and
inclusion of PostScript, PNG, JPEG or GIF images.
