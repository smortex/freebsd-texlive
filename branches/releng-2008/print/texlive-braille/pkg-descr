This package allows the user to produce Braille documents on
paper for the blind without knowing Braille (which can take
years to learn). Python scripts grade1.py and grade2.py convert
ordinary text to grade 1 and 2 braille tags; then, the LaTeX
package braille.sty takes the tags and prints out corresponding
braille symbols.
