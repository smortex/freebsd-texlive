Allows figures to have text wrapped around them. Does not work
in combination with list environments, but can be used in a
parbox or minipage, and in twocolumn format. Supports the float
package. Note that most of the package documentation is
contained in wrapfig.sty itself (after the \endinput command at
the end of the package proper).
