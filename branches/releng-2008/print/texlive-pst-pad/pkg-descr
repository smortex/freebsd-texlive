The package collects a set of graphical elements based on
PStricks that can be used to facilitate display of attachment
systems such as two differently shaped surfaces with or without
a fluid wedged in between. These macros ease the display of wet
adhesion models and common friction systems such as boundary
lubrication, elastohydrodynamic lubrication and hydrodynamic
lubrication.
