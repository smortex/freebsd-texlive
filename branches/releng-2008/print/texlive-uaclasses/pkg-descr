This package provides a LaTeX2e document class named ‘ua-
thesis’ for typesetting theses and dissertations in the
official format required by the University of Arizona.
Moreover, there is a fully compatible alternative document
class ‘my-thesis’ for private ‘nice’ copies of the
dissertation, and the respective title pages are available as
separate packages to work with any document class.
