The glossaries package supports acronyms and multiple
glossaries, and has provision for operation in several
languages. New entries are defined to have a name and
description (and optionally an associated symbol). Support for
multiple languages is offered, and plural forms of terms may be
specified. The user may define new glossary styles, and
preambles and postambles can be specified. There is provision
for loading a database of terms, but only terms used in the
text will be added to the relevant glossary. The package uses
an indexing program to provide the actual glossary; either
makeindex or xindy may serve this purpose, and a Perl script is
provided to serve as interface. The package distribution also
provides the mfirstuc package, for changing the first letter of
a word to upper case. The package supersedes the author‘s
glossary package (which is now obsolete), and a conversion tool
is provided.
