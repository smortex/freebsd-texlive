A package which allows the user to set tensor-style super- and
subscripts with offsets between successive indices. It supports
the typesetting of tensors with mixed upper and lower indices
with spacing, also typset preposed indices. This is a complete
revision and extension of the original ‘tensor’ package by
Mike Piff.
