There are a lot of packages for typesetting units in LaTeX2e.
Some define macros to typeset a lot of units but do not suit to
the actual font settings, some make the characters needed
available but do not predefine any unit. This package tries to
comply with both requirements. It predefines common units,
defines an easy to use interface to define new units and
changes the output concerning to the surrounding font settings.
