The package modifies the behaviour of characters in maths mode
so that: ‘.’ is used as a one-thousand separator (as is
common in Germany) ‘,’ is used as a decimal separator (as
is common in Germany) ‘--’ is represented with spacing as
appropriate to such constructs as ‘1.000,--’. These
conversions may be switched on and off.
