This package defines a macro to place objects (tables and
figures) and their captions in different positions with
different rotating angles within a float. All objects and
captions can be framed. The main command is \hvFloat{float
type}{floating object}{caption}{label}; a simple example is
\hvFloat{figure}{\includegraphics{rose}}{Caption}{fig:0}.
Options are included to place captions to the right or left,
and rotated. Setting nonFloat=true results in placing the float
here.
