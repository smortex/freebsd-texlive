The progam mkjobtexmf runs a program and tries to find the used
file names. Two methods are available, option "-recorder" of
TeX (Web2C) or the program strace. Then it generates a
directory with a texmf tree. It checks the found files and
tries sort them in this texmf tree. It can be used for
archiving purposes or to speed up following TeX runs.
