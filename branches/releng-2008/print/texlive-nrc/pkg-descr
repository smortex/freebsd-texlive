Macros, and some documentation, for typesetting papers for
submission to journals published by the National Research
Council of Canada. The macros are provided as a pair of
classes, one for journals printed in two columns and the other
for journals (such as the Canadian Journal of Physics, post-
1997) which are printed in a single-column format.
