DTL (DVI Text Language) is a means of expressing the content of
a DVI file, which is readily readable by humans. The DTL bundle
contains an assembler dt2dv (which produces DVI files from DTL
files) and a disassembler dv2dt (which produces DTL files from
DVI files). The DTL bundle was developed so as to avoid some
infelicities of dvitype (among other pressing reasons).
