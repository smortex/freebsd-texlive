The refstyle provides a consistent way of producing references
throughout a project. Enough flexibility is provided to make
local changes to a single reference. The user can configure
their own setup. refstyle has a direct interface to varioref,
and namerefs from the nameref package can easily be
incorporated (if needed). For large projects such as a series
of books or a multi volume thesis, written as freestanding
documents, a facility is provided to interface to the xr
package for external document references.
