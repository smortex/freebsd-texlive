Lists are defined as a sequence of tokens separated by a comma.
The coollist package allows the user to access certain elements
of the list while neglecting othersâ€”essentially turning lists
into a sort of array. Lists elements are accessed by specifying
the position of the object within the list (the index of the
item).
