This package provides a command much like hyperref’s \url
that typesets a URL using a typewriter-like font. However, if
the dvips driver is being used, the original \url doesn’t
allow line breaks in the middle of the created link: the link
comes in one atomic piece. This package allows such line breaks
in the generated links.
