The package simplifies typesetting of simple crystallographic
group-subgroup-schemes in the BÃ¤rnighausen formalism. It
defines a new environment stammbaum, wherein all elements of
the scheme are defined. Afterwards all necessary dimensions are
calculated and the scheme is drawn. Currently two steps of
symmetry reduction are supported.
