This package provides only two macros viz. \modromannumeral
which writes the number given as argument in lower case roman
numeral with a ‘j’ instead of a ‘i’ as the final letter
of numbers greater than 1 and \modroman{MyCounter} which writes
the value of a counter in the same way. You use the first in
the same way as the TeX primitive \romannumeral and the second
as LaTeX command \roman. The default option is ‘vpourv’
with which 5 is ‘translated’ by ‘v’ and option
‘upourv’ whith which the same 5 is given as ‘u’.
