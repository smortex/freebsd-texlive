The package provides macros \DeclareRobustActChar and
ReDeclareRobActChar. One uses \DeclareRobustActChar in the same
way one would use \DeclareRobustCommand; the macro \protects
the active character when it appears in a moving argument.
ReDeclareRobActChar redefines an active character previously
defined with \DeclareRobustActChar, in the same way that
\renewcommand works for ordinary commands.
