The package allows the user to use the computer algebra system
XCAS to generate tables of signs and of variations (the actual
plotting of the tables uses the MetaPost macro package
tableauVariations). Tables with forbidden regions may be
developed using the package. A configuration file permits some
configuration of the language to be used in the diagrams. The
tablor package requires that shell escape be enabled.
