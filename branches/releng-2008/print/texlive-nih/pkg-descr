The nih class offers support for grant applications to NIH, the
National Institutes of Health, a US government agency. The
example-* files provide a template for using nih.cls and
submitting the biographical sketches the NIH wants. They
(potentially) use denselists package, which just reduces list
spacing; the package is distributed with the class, but is not
part of the class proper. (The examples may be distributed
without even the restrictions of the LaTeX licence.)
