The package enables left subscripts and superscripts in maths
mode. The sub- and superscripts are raised for optimum fitting
to the symbol indexed, in such a way that left and right sub-
and superscripts are set on the same level, as appropriate. The
package provides an alternative to the use of the \sideset
command in the amsmath package.
