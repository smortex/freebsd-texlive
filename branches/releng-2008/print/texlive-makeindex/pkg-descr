A general purpose hierarchical index generator; it accepts one
or more input files (often produced by a text formatter such as
TeX or troff), sorts the entries, and produces an output file
which can be formatted. The formats of the input and output
files are specified in a style file; by default, input is
assumed to be an idx file, as generated by LaTeX.
