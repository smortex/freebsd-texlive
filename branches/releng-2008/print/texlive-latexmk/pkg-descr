Latexmk completely automates the process of generating a LaTeX
document. Given the source files for a document, latexmk issues
the appropriate sequence of commands to generate a .dvi, .ps,
.pdf or hardcopy version of the document. An important feature
is the “preview continuous mode”, where the script watches
all of the source files (primary file and included TeX and
graphics files), and reruns LaTeX, etc., whenever a source file
has changed. Thus a previewer can have an updated display
whenever the source files change.
