The jeopardy package allows to build a jeopardy game with
pdfLaTeX. It is based on the jj_game class and exerquiz
package, written by D. P. Story. The author of the game can use
multichoice questions or fill-in questions. The answer for
fill-in questions is either a mathematical formula or text
string (see the documentation of exerquiz and \RespBoxMath and
\RespBoxTxt commands to learn more about the capabilities).
JavaScripts are written to record the score. If the score is
greater than a given value, a hidden string is shown. The user
should use the style with some screen presentation package,
such as web or pdfscreen. The package is distributed with some
example games, including both 1- and 2-player games.
