There are two primary forms of citation in the Harvard style,
dependent upon whether the reference is used as a noun or
parenthetically. The citations themselves are in author-date
style, with authors after the first suppressed in repeat
citations. The three original bibliography styles are agsm.bst
(for Australian Government publications), dcu.bst (from the
Design Computing Unit of the University of Sydney) and
kluwer.bst (aiming at the format preferred in Kluwer
publications). This package is no longer recommended for use:
the harvard package for LaTeX 2e should be used instead.
