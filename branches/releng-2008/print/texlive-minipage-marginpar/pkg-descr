This package allows \marginpar-commands inside of minipages and
other boxes. (It takes another approach than marginnote by
Markus Kohm: it saves all \marginpar-commands and typesets them
outside (i.e., after) the box.) The package defines an
environment minipagewithmarginpars (to be used like
minipage)â€”and the internal commands may be used by other
packages to define similar environments or commands.
