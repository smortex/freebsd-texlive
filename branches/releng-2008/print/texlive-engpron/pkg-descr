This package provides macros beginning with the ‘’
character, made active, which enable us to write the British or
American English pronunciation as one can find it in the
‘English Pronouncing Dictionary’ by Daniel Jones. There is
an option to typeset the pronunciation in the style of
Harrap’s dictionary.
