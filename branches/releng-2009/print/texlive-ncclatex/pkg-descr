The ncc class provides a framework for a common class to
replace the standard article, book and report classes, and
providing a "preprint" class. The class's extensions are
provided in a number of small packages, some of which may also
be used with the standard classes. The ncclatex package also
loads many of the packages of, and requires the latest version
of the ncctools bundle.
