The package provides an indirection scheme for XeTeX to use the
pstricks xdvipdfmx.con configuration file, so that XeTeX
documents will load it in preference to the standard
pstricks.con configuration file. With this configuration, many
PSTricks features can be used in xelatex or plain xetex
documents.
