This package lets you typeset keywords of the version control
system Subversion inside your LaTeX files anywhere you like.
Unlike the otherwise similar package svn the use of multiple
files for one LaTeX document is well supported. The package
interacts with an external Perl script, to retrieve information
necessary for the required output.
