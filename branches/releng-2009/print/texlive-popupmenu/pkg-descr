The package creates a menu structure (an array of menu items),
which is passed to the Acrobat JavaScript method
app.popUpMenuEx() which creates the popup menu. Using the
environments defined in this package, and the command
\popUpMenu, you can create and display hierarchical menus. Menu
items can have JavaScript actions associated with them, or they
may be marked and disabled. The package only requires hyperref;
it will run with over any of the conventional means of
generating PDF (LaTeX via dvips or dvipdfm, or PDFLaTeX).
