This package provides array data structures in (La)TeX, in the
meaning of the classical procedural programming languages like
Fortran, Ada or C, and macros to manipulate them. Arrays can be
mono or bi-dimensional. This is useful for applications which
require high level programming techniques, like algorithmic
graphics programmed in the TeX language. The package supersedes
the arrayjob package.
