The package is for use in Qualitative Data Analysis research.
It supports the integration of Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA)
research tasks, specifically for Grounded Theory, into the
LaTeX work flow. It assists in the analysis of textual data
such as interview transcripts and field notes by providing the
LaTeX user with macros which are used to markup textual
information -- for example, in-depth interviews.
